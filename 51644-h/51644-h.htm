<p class="pr6 p2"><span class="smcap">Branches Park</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>November 3rd, 1904</i>.</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">I wonder</span> so much if it is amusing to be an
adventuress, because that is evidently what I
shall become now. I read in a book all about
it; it is being nice-looking and having nothing
to live on, and getting a pleasant time out of
life&mdash;and I intend to do that! I have certainly
nothing to live on, for one cannot count £300
a year&mdash;and I am extremely pretty, and I know
it quite well, and how to do my hair, and put
on my hats, and those things, so, of course, I
am an adventuress! I was not intended for
this <i>rôle</i>&mdash;in fact Mrs. Carruthers adopted me
on purpose to leave me her fortune, as at that
time she had quarrelled with her heir, who was
bound to get the place. Then she was so inconsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as not to make a proper will&mdash;thus
it is that this creature gets everything, and I
nothing!</p>

<p>I am twenty, and up to the week before last,
when Mrs. Carruthers got ill, and died in one
day, I had had a fairly decent time at odd
moments when she was in a good temper.</p>

<p>There is no use pretending even when people
are dead, if one is writing down one’s real
thoughts. I detested Mrs. Carruthers most of
the time. A person whom it was impossible to
please. She had no idea of justice, or of anything
but her own comfort, and what amount
of pleasure other people could contribute to her
day!</p>

<p>How she came to do anything for me at all
was because she had been in love with papa,
and when he married poor mamma&mdash;a person
of no family&mdash;and then died, she offered to
take me, and bring me up, just to spite mamma,
she has often told me. As I was only four I
had no say in the matter, and if mamma liked
to give me up that was her affair. Mamma’s
father was a lord, and her mother I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
who, and they had not worried to get married,
so that is how it is poor mamma came to have
no relations. After papa was dead she married
an Indian officer, and went off to India, and
died too, and I never saw her any more&mdash;so
there it is, there is not a soul in the world who
matters to me, or I to them, so I can’t help
being an adventuress, and thinking only of
myself, can I?</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers periodically quarrelled with
all the neighbours, so beyond frigid calls now
and then in a friendly interval, we never saw
them much. Several old, worldly ladies used
to come to stay, but I liked none of them,
and I have no young friends. When it is
getting dark, and I am up here alone, I often
wonder what it would be like if I had&mdash;but I
believe I am the kind of cat that would not
have got on with them too nicely&mdash;so perhaps it
is just as well; only to have had a pretty&mdash;aunt,
say, to love one, that might have been nice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers had no feelings like this.
“Stuff and nonsense”&mdash;“sentimental rubbish”
she would have called them. To get a suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
husband is what she brought me up for, she
said, and for the last years had arranged that I
should marry her detested heir, Christopher
Carruthers, as I should have the money, and
he the place.</p>

<p>He is a diplomat, and lives in Paris, and
Russia, and amusing places like that, so he
does not often come to England. I have never
seen him. He is quite old&mdash;over thirty&mdash;and
has hair turning gray.</p>

<p>Now he is master here, and I must leave&mdash;unless
he proposes to marry me at our
meeting this afternoon, which he probably
won’t do.</p>

<p>However, there can be no harm in my
making myself look as attractive as possible
under the circumstances. As I am to be an
adventuress, I must do the best I can for myself.
Nice feelings are for people who have
money to live as they please. If I had ten
thousand a year, or even five, I would snap my
fingers at all men, and say, “No, I make my
life as I choose, and shall cultivate knowledge
and books, and indulge in beautiful ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
honour and exalted sentiments, and perhaps
one day succumb to a noble passion.” (What
grand words the thought even is making me
write!!) But as it is, if Mr. Carruthers asks
me to marry him, as he has been told to do
by his aunt, I shall certainly say yes, and so
stay on here, and have a comfortable home.
Until I have had this interview it is hardly
worth while packing anything.</p>

<p>What a mercy black suits me! My skin is
ridiculously white&mdash;I shall stick a bunch of
violets in my frock, that could not look heartless,
I suppose. But if he asks me if I am sad
about Mrs. Carruthers’ death, I shall not be
able to tell a lie.</p>

<p>I am sad, of course, because death is a
terrible thing, and to die like that, saying spiteful
things to every one, must be horrid&mdash;but
I can’t, I can’t regret her! Not a day ever
passed that she did not sting some part of me&mdash;when
I was little, it was not only with her
tongue, she used to pinch me, and box my ears
until Doctor Garrison said it might make me
deaf, and then she stopped, because she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
deaf people were a bore, and she could not put
up with them.</p>

<p>I shall not go on looking back! There are
numbers of things that even now make me
raging to remember.</p>

<p>I have only been out for a year. Mrs. Carruthers
got an attack of bronchitis when I was
eighteen, just as we were going up to town for
the season, and said she did not feel well
enough for the fatigues, and off we went to
Switzerland. And in the autumn we travelled
all over the place, and in the winter she coughed
and groaned, and the next season would not
go up until the last court, so I have only had
a month of London. The bronchitis got perfectly
well, it was heart-failure that killed her,
brought on by an attack of temper because
Thomas broke the Carruthers vase.</p>

<p>I shall not write of her death, or the finding
of the will, or the surprise that I was left nothing
but a thousand pounds, and a diamond
ring.</p>

<p>Now that I am an adventuress, instead of
an heiress, of what good to chronicle all that!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Sufficient to say if Mr. Carruthers does not
obey his orders, and offer me his hand this
afternoon, I shall have to pack my trunks, and
depart by Saturday&mdash;but where to is yet in
the lap of the gods!</p>

<p>He is coming by the 3.20 train, and will
be in the house before four, an ugly, dull
time; one can’t offer him tea, and it will be
altogether trying and exciting.</p>

<p>He is coming ostensibly to take over his
place, I suppose, but in reality it is to look at
me, and see if in any way he will be able to
persuade himself to carry out his aunt’s wishes.
I wonder what it will be like to be married to
some one you don’t know, and don’t like? I
am not greatly acquainted yet with the ways
of men. We have not had any that you could
call that here, much&mdash;only a lot of old wicked
sort of things, in the autumn, to shoot the
pheasants, and play bridge with Mrs. Carruthers.
The marvel to me was how they ever
killed anything, such antiques they were!
Some Politicians and ex-Ambassadors, and
creatures of that sort; and mostly as wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
as could be. They used to come trotting down
the passage to the schoolroom, and have tea
with Mademoiselle and me on the slightest
provocation! and say such things! I am sure
lots of what they said meant something else,
Mademoiselle used to giggle so. She was rather
a good-looking one I had the last four years,
but I hated her. There was never anyone
young and human who counted.</p>

<p>I did look forward to coming out in London,
but, being so late, every one was preoccupied
when we got there&mdash;and no one got in
love with me much. Indeed, we went out very
little, a part of the time I had a swollen nose
from a tennis ball at Ranelagh&mdash;and people
don’t look at girls with swollen noses.</p>

<p>I wonder where I shall go and live! Perhaps
in Paris&mdash;unless, of course, I marry Mr. Carruthers,&mdash;I
don’t suppose it is dull being married.
In London all the married ones seemed
to have a lovely time, and had not to bother
with their husbands much.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers always assured me love
was a thing of absolutely no consequence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
marriage. You were bound to love some one,
some time, but the very fact of being chained
to him would dispel the feeling. It was a thing
to be looked upon like measles, or any other
disease, and was better to get it over, and then
turn to the solid affairs of life. But how she
expected me to get it over when she never
arranged for me to see anyone I don’t know.</p>

<p>I asked her one day what I should do if I
got to like some one after I am married to Mr.
Carruthers, and she laughed one of her horrid
laughs, and said I should probably do as the
rest of the world. And what do they do?&mdash;I
wonder?&mdash;Well, I suppose I shall find out
some day.</p>

<p>Of course there is the possibility that Christopher
(do I like the name of Christopher, I
wonder?)&mdash;well, that Christopher may not
want to follow her will.</p>

<p>He has known about it for years, I suppose,
just as I have, but I believe men are queer
creatures, and he may take a dislike to me. I
am not a type that would please every one.
My hair is too red, brilliant dark fiery red like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a chestnut when it tumbles out of its shell,
only burnished like metal. If I had the usual
white eyelashes I should be downright ugly,
but, thank goodness! by some freak of nature
mine are black and thick, and stick out when
you look at me sideways, and I often think
when I catch sight of myself in the glass that
I am really very pretty&mdash;all put together&mdash;but,
as I said before, not a type to please every
one.</p>

<p>A combination I am that Mrs. Carruthers
assured me would cause anxieties. “With
that mixture, Evangeline,” she often said,
“you would do well to settle yourself in life
as soon as possible. Good girls don’t have your
colouring.” So you see, as I am branded as bad
from the beginning, it does not much matter
what I do. My eyes are as green as pale emeralds,
and long, and not going down at the
corners with the Madonna expression of Cicely
Parker, the Vicar’s daughter. I do not know
yet what is being good, or being bad, perhaps
I shall find out when I am an adventuress, or
married to Mr. Carruthers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>All I know is that I want to <i>live</i>, and feel
the blood rushing through my veins. I want
to do as I please, and not have to be polite
when I am burning with rage. I want to be
late in the morning if I happen to fancy sleeping,
and I want to sit up at night if I don’t
want to go to bed! So, as you can do what
you like when you are married, I really hope
Mr. Carruthers will take a fancy to me, and
then all will be well! I shall stay upstairs until
I hear the carriage-wheels, and leave Mr.
Barton&mdash;the lawyer&mdash;to receive him. Then I
shall saunter down nonchalantly while they
are in the hall. It will be an effective entrance.
My trailing black garments, and the great
broad stairs&mdash;this is a splendid house&mdash;and if
he has an eye in his head he must see my foot
on each step! Even Mrs. Carruthers said I
have the best foot she had ever seen. I am
getting quite excited. I shall ring for Véronique
and begin to dress!... I shall write more
presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Thursday evening.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is evening, and the fire is burning brightly
in my sitting-room where I am writing. <i>My</i>
sitting-room!&mdash;did I say? Mr. Carruthers’
sitting-room I meant&mdash;for it is mine no longer,
and on Saturday, the day after to-morrow, I
shall have to bid good-bye to it forever.</p>

<p>For yes&mdash;I may as well say it at once&mdash;the
affair did not walk. Mr. Carruthers quietly,
but firmly, refused to obey his aunt’s will, and
thus I am left an old maid!</p>

<p>I must go back to this afternoon to make it
clear, and I must say my ears tingle as I think
of it.</p>

<p>I rang for Véronique, and put on my new
black afternoon frock, which had just been unpacked.
I tucked in the violets in a careless
way. Saw that my hair was curling as vigorously
as usual, and not too rebelliously for a
demure appearance, and so, at exactly the right
moment, began to descend the stairs.</p>

<p>There was Mr. Carruthers in the hall. A
horribly nice-looking, tall man, with a clean-shaven
face, and features cut out of stone. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
square chin, with a nasty twinkle in the corner
of his eye. He has a very distinguished look,
and that air of never having had to worry for
his things to fit, they appear as if they had
grown on him. He has a cold, reserved manner,
and something commanding and arrogant
in it, which makes one want to contradict him
at once, but his voice is charming. One of that
cultivated, refined kind, that sounds as if he
spoke a number of languages, and so does not
slur his words. I believe this is diplomatic,
for some of the old ambassador people had this
sort of voice.</p>

<p>He was standing with his back to the fire,
and the light of the big window with the sun
getting low was full on his face, so I had a good
look at him. I said in the beginning that there
was no use pretending when one is writing
one’s own thoughts for one’s own self to read
when one is old, and keeping them in a locked-up
journal, so I shall always tell the truth here&mdash;quite
different things to what I should say
if I were talking to someone, and describing to
them this scene. Then I should say I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
him utterly unattractive, and in fact, I hardly
noticed him! As it was, I noticed him very
much, and I have a tiresome inward conviction
that he could be very attractive indeed, if he
liked.</p>

<p>He looked up, and I came forward with my
best demure air, as Mr. Barton nervously introduced
us, and we shook hands. I left him to
speak first.</p>

<p>“Abominably cold day,” he said, carelessly.
That was English and promising!</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” I said. “You have just arrived?”</p>

<p>And so we continued in this banal way, with
Mr. Barton twirling his thumbs, and hoping,
one could see, that we should soon come to
the business of the day; interposing a remark
here and there, which added to the <i>gêne</i> of the
situation.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Carruthers said to Mr. Barton
that he would go round and see the house;
and I said tea would be ready when they got
back. And so they started.</p>

<p>My cheeks would burn, and my hands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
so cold, it was awkward and annoying, not
half the simple affair I had thought it would
be upstairs.</p>

<p>When it was quite dark, and the lamps were
brought, they came back to the hall, and Mr.
Barton, saying he did not want any tea, left
us to find papers in the library.</p>

<p>I gave Mr. Carruthers some tea, and asked
the usual things about sugar and cream. His
eye had almost a look of contempt as he glanced
at me, and I felt an angry throb in my throat.
When he had finished he got up, and stood
before the fire again. Then, deliberately, as a
man who has determined to do his duty at any
cost, he began to speak:</p>

<p>“You know the wish&mdash;or rather, I should
say, the command, my aunt left me,” he said&mdash;“in
fact she states that she had always
brought you up to the idea. It is rather a tiresome
thing to discuss with a stranger, but
perhaps we had better get it over as soon as
possible, as that is what I came down here
to-day for. The command was, I should
marry you.”&mdash;He paused a moment. I remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
perfectly still, with my hands idly
clasped in my lap, and made myself keep my
eyes on his face.</p>

<p>He continued, finding I did not answer&mdash;just
a faint tone of resentment creeping into
his voice&mdash;because I would not help him out,
I suppose&mdash;I should think not! I loved annoying
him!</p>

<p>“It is a preposterous idea in these days for
any one to dispose of people’s destinies in this
way, and I am sure you will agree with me that
such a marriage would be impossible.”</p>

<p>“Of course I agree,” I replied, lying with a
tone of careless sincerity. I had to control all
my real feelings of either anger or pleasure for
so long in Mrs. Carruthers’ presence that I am
now an adept.</p>

<p>“I am so glad you put it so plainly,” I went
on sweetly. “I was wondering how I should
write it to you, but now you are here it is quite
easy for us to finish the matter at once. Whatever
Mrs. Carruthers may have intended me
to do, I had no intention of obeying her, but
it would have been useless for me to say so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
her, and so I waited until the time for speech
should come. Won’t you have some more tea?”</p>

<p>He looked at me very straightly, almost
angrily, for an instant; presently, with a sigh
of relief, he said, half laughing&mdash;</p>

<p>“Then we are agreed, we need say no more
about it!”</p>

<p>“No more,” I answered, and I smiled too,
although a rage of anger was clutching my
throat. I do not know who I was angry with&mdash;Mrs.
Carruthers for procuring this situation,
Christopher for being insensible to my charms,
or myself for ever having contemplated for a
second the possibility of his doing otherwise.
Why, when one thinks of it calmly, should he
want to marry me? A penniless adventuress
with green eyes, and red hair, that he had never
seen before in his life. I hoped he thought I
was a person of naturally high colour, because
my cheeks from the moment I began to dress
had been burning and burning. It might have
given him the idea the scene was causing me
some emotion, and that he should never know!</p>

<p>He took some more tea, but he did not drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it, and by this I guessed that he also was not
as calm as he looked!</p>

<p>“There is something else,” he said. And
now there was almost an awkwardness in his
voice. “Something else which I want to say,
though perhaps Mr. Barton could say it for me&mdash;but
which I would rather say straight to
you&mdash;and that is you must let me settle such a
sum of money on you as you had every right
to expect from my aunt, after the promises I
understand she always made to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>This time I did not wait for him to finish!
I bounded up from my seat&mdash;some uncontrollable
sensation of wounded pride throbbing and
thrilling through me.</p>

<p>“Money!&mdash;Money from you!” I exclaimed.
“Not if I were starving!”&mdash;then I sat down
again, ashamed of this vehemence. How would
he interpret it! But it galled me so, and yet I
had been ready an hour ago to have accepted
him as my husband! Why, then, this revolt at
the idea of receiving a fair substitute in gold?
Really, one is a goose, and I had time to realize,
even in this tumult of emotion, that there can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
nothing so inconsistent as the feelings of a
girl.</p>

<p>“You must not be foolish!” he said, coldly.
“I intend to settle the money whether you will
or no, so do not make any further trouble
about it!”</p>

<p>There was something in his voice so commanding
and arrogant, just as I noticed at first,
that every obstinate quality in my nature rose
to answer him.</p>

<p>“I do not know anything about the law in
the matter; you may settle what you choose,
but I shall never touch any of it,” I said, as
calmly as I could; “so it seems ridiculous to
waste the money, does it not? You may not,
perhaps, be aware I have enough of my own,
and do not in any way require yours.”</p>

<p>He became colder and more exasperated.</p>

<p>“As you please, then,” he said, snappishly,
and Mr. Barton, fortunately entering at that
moment, the conversation was cut short, and I
left them.</p>

<p>They are not going back to London until to-morrow
morning, and dinner has yet to be got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
through. Oh! I do feel in a temper, and I can
never tell of the emotions that were throbbing
through me as I came up the great stairs just
now. A sudden awakening to the humiliation
of the situation! How had I ever been able to
contemplate marrying a man I did not know,
just to secure myself a comfortable home! It
seems preposterous now. I suppose it was because
I have always been brought up to the
idea, and until I came face to face with the
man, it did not strike me as odd. Fortunately
he can never guess that I had been willing to
accept him&mdash;my dissimulation has stood me in
good stead. Now I am animated by only one
idea! To appear as agreeable and charming to
Mr. Carruthers as possible. The aim and object
of my life shall be to make him regret his
decision. When I hear him imploring me to
marry him, I shall regain a little of my self-respect!
And as for marriage, I shall have nothing
to do with the horrid affair! Oh dear no!
I shall go away free, and be a happy adventuress&mdash;I
have read the “Trois Mousquetaires,” and
“Vingt Ans Après”&mdash;Mademoiselle had them&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I remember milady had only three days
to get round her jailer, starting with his hating
her, whereas Mr. Carruthers does not hate me,
so that counts against my only having one
evening. I shall do my best&mdash;!</p>


<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Thursday night.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> down in the library, innocently reading
a book when Mr. Carruthers came in. He
looked even better in evening dress, but he
appeared ill-tempered, and no doubt found the
situation unpleasant.</p>

<p>“Is not this a beautiful house?” I said, in
a velvet voice, to break the awkward silence,
and show him I did not share his unease. “You
had not seen it before, for ages, had you?”</p>

<p>“Not since I was a boy,” he answered, trying
to be polite. “My aunt quarrelled with
my father&mdash;she was the direct heiress of all
this, and married her cousin, my father’s younger
brother&mdash;but you know the family history, of
course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“They hated one another, she and my
father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Carruthers hated all her relations,” I
said demurely.</p>

<p>“Myself among them?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said slowly, and bent forward, so
that the lamplight should fall upon my hair.
“She said you were too much like herself in
character for you ever to be friends.”</p>

<p>“Is that a compliment?” he asked, and
there was a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“We must speak no ill of the dead,” I said,
evasively.</p>

<p>He looked slightly annoyed, as much as
these diplomats ever let themselves look anything.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said. “Let her rest in
peace.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with your life
now?” he asked, presently. It was a bald
question.</p>

<p>“I shall become an adventuress,” I answered
deliberately.</p>

<p>“A <i>what</i>?” he exclaimed, his black eyebrows
contracting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“An adventuress. Is not that what it is
called? A person who sees life, and has to do
the best she can for herself.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “You strange little lady?” he
said, his irritation with me melting. And when
he laughs you can see how even his teeth are,
but the two side ones are sharp and pointed
like a wolf’s.</p>

<p>“Perhaps after all you had better have
married me!”</p>

<p>“No, that would clip my wings,” I said
frankly, looking at him straight in the face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barton tells me you propose leaving
here on Saturday. I beg you will not do so&mdash;please
consider it your home for so long as you
wish&mdash;until you can make some arrangements
for yourself. You look so very young to be
going about the world alone!”</p>

<p>He bent down and gazed at me closer&mdash;there
was an odd tone in his voice.</p>

<p>“I am twenty, and I have been often
snubbed,” I said, calmly; “that prepares one
for a good deal. I shall enjoy doing what I
please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what are you going to please?”</p>

<p>“I shall go to Claridge’s until I can look
about me.”</p>

<p>He moved uneasily.</p>

<p>“But have you no relations? No one who
will take care of you?”</p>

<p>“I believe none. My mother was nobody
particular you know&mdash;a Miss Tonkins by
name.”</p>

<p>“But your father?” He sat down now on the
sofa beside me; there was a puzzled, amused
look in his face&mdash;perhaps I was amazing
him.</p>

<p>“Papa? Oh! Papa was the last of his family&mdash;they
were decent people, but there are no
more of them.”</p>

<p>He pushed one of the cushions aside.</p>

<p>“It is an impossible position for a girl&mdash;completely
alone. I cannot allow it. I feel
responsible for you. After all, it would do
very well if you married me&mdash;I am not particularly
domestic by nature, and should be very
little at home&mdash;so you could live here, and
have a certain position, and I would come back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
now and then to see you were getting on all
right.”</p>

<p>One could not say if he were mocking, or no.</p>

<p>“It is too good of you,” I said, without any
irony, “but I like freedom, and when you
were at home it might be such a bore&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He leant back, and laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“You are candid, at any rate!” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton came into the room at that
moment, full of apologies for being late. Immediately
after, with the usual ceremony, the
butler entered and pompously announced,
“Dinner is served, sir.” How quickly they
recognize the new master!</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers gave me his arm, and we
walked slowly down the picture gallery to the
banqueting hall, and there sat down at the
small round table in the middle, that always
looks like an island in a lake.</p>

<p>I talked nicely at dinner. I was dignified
and grave, and quite frank. Mr. Carruthers
was not bored. The <i>chef</i> had outdone himself,
hoping to be kept on. I never felt so excited
in my life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>I was apparently asleep under a big lamp,
after dinner in the library&mdash;a book of silly
poetry in my lap&mdash;when the door opened and
he&mdash;Mr. Carruthers&mdash;came in alone, and
walked up the room. I did not open my eyes.
He looked for just a minute&mdash;how accurate I
am! Then he said, “You are very pretty when
asleep!”</p>

<p>His voice was not caressing, or complimentary,
merely as if the fact had forced this utterance.</p>

<p>I allowed myself to wake without a start.</p>

<p>“Was the ’47 port as good as you hoped?”
I asked, sympathetically.</p>

<p>He sat down. I had arranged my chair so
that there was none other in its immediate
neighbourhood. Thus he was some way off,
and could realize my whole silhouette.</p>

<p>“The ’47 port&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;but I am not
going to talk of port. I want you to tell me
a lot more about yourself, and your plans.”</p>

<p>“I have no plans&mdash;except to see the world.”</p>

<p>He picked up a book, and put it down
again; he was not perfectly calm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall let you. I am more
than ever convinced you ought to have some
one to take care of you; you are not of the
type that makes it altogether safe to roam
about alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh! as for my type,” I said, languidly,
“I know all about that. Mrs. Carruthers said
no one with this combination of colour could
be good, so I am not going to try. It will be
quite simple.”</p>

<p>He rose quickly from his chair, and stood
in front of the great log fire, such a comical
expression on his face.</p>

<p>“You are the quaintest child I have ever
met,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am not a child&mdash;and I mean to know
everything I can.”</p>

<p>He went over towards the sofa again, and
arranged the cushions&mdash;great, splendid, fat
pillows of old Italian brocade, stiff with gold
and silver.</p>

<p>“Come!” he pleaded, “sit here beside me,
and let us talk; you are miles away there, and
I want to&mdash;make you see reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>I rose at once, and came slowly to where he
pointed. I settled myself deliberately, there
was one cushion of purple and silver right
under the light, and there I rested my head.</p>

<p>“Now talk!” I said, and half closed my
eyes.</p>

<p>Oh! I was enjoying myself! The first time
I have ever been alone with a real man! They&mdash;the
old ambassadors, and politicians, and
generals, used always to tell me I should grow
into an attractive woman&mdash;now I meant to try
what I could do.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers remained silent&mdash;but he sat
down beside me, and looked, and looked right
into my eyes.</p>

<p>“Now talk then,” I said again.</p>

<p>“Do you know, you are a very disturbing
person,” he said at last, by way of a beginning.</p>

<p>“What is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It is a woman who confuses one’s thought
when one looks at her. I do not now seem to
have anything to say&mdash;or too much.”</p>

<p>“You called me a child.”</p>

<p>“I should have called you an enigma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>I assured him I was not the least complex,
and that I only wanted everything simple, and
to be left in peace, without having to get
married, or worry to obey people.</p>

<p>We had a nice talk.</p>

<p>“You won’t leave here on Saturday,” he
said, presently, apropos of nothing. “I do not
think I shall go myself, to-morrow. I want
you to show me all over the gardens, and your
favourite haunts.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall be busy packing,” I
said, gravely, “and I do not think I want to
show you the gardens&mdash;there are some corners
I rather loved&mdash;I believe it will hurt a little to
say good-bye.”</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Barton came into the room,
fussy and ill at ease. Mr. Carruthers’ face
hardened again, and I rose to say good-night.</p>

<p>As he opened the door for me: “Promise
you will come down to give me my coffee in
the morning,” he said.</p>

<p>“<i>Qui vivra verra</i>,” I answered, and sauntered
out into the hall. He followed me, and
watched as I went up the staircase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night!” I called softly, as I got to
the top, and laughed a little&mdash;I don’t know why.</p>

<p>He bounded up the stairs, three steps at a
time, and before I could turn the handle of my
door, he stood beside me.</p>

<p>“I do not know what there is about you,”
he said, “but you drive me mad&mdash;I shall insist
upon carrying out my aunt’s wish after all!
I shall marry you, and never let you out of my
sight&mdash;do you hear?”</p>

<p>Oh! such a strange sense of exaltation crept
over me&mdash;it is with me still! Of course he
probably will not mean all that to-morrow, but
to have made such a stiff block of stone rush
upstairs, and say this much now is perfectly
delightful!</p>

<p>I looked at him up from under my eyelashes.
“No, you will not marry me,” I said, calmly;
“or do anything else I don’t like, and now
really good-night!” and I slipped into my
room, and closed the door. I could hear he did
not stir for some seconds. Then he went off
down the stairs again, and I am alone with my
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>My thoughts! I wonder what they mean.
What did I do that had this effect upon him?
I intended to do something, and I did it, but
I am not quite sure what it was. However,
that is of no consequence. Sufficient for me to
know that my self-respect is restored, and I can
now go out and see the world with a clear
conscience.</p>

<p><i>He</i> has asked me to marry him! and <i>I</i> have
said I won’t!</p>

<p class="pr6 p2"><span class="smcap">Branches Park</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Thursday night, Nov. 3rd, 1904</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bob</span>,&mdash;A quaint thing has happened
to me! Came down here to take over the place,
and to say decidedly I would not marry Miss
Travers, and I find her with red hair and a skin
like milk, and a pair of green eyes that look
at you from a forest of black eyelashes with
a thousand unsaid challenges. I should not
wonder if I commit some folly. One has read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of women like this in the <i>cinque-cento</i> time in
Italy, but up to now I had never met one. She
is not in the room ten minutes before one feels
a sense of unrest, and desire for one hardly
knows what&mdash;principally to touch her, I fancy.
Good Lord! what a skin! pure milk and
rare roses&mdash;and the reddest Cupid’s bow of a
mouth! You had better come down at once,
(these things are probably in your line) to save
me from some sheer idiocy. The situation is
exceptional; she and I practically alone in the
house, for old Barton does not count. She has
nowhere to go, and as far as I can make out
has not a friend in the world. I suppose I ought
to leave&mdash;I will try to on Monday, but come
down to-morrow by the 4 train.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours,</p>

<p class="p1">P.S. ’47 port A1, and two or three brands

Evangeline’s possession later, and which she put into her

<p class="pr6 p1"><span class="smcap">Branches</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Friday night, November 4th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> morning Mr. Carruthers had his coffee
alone. Mr. Barton and I breakfasted quite early,
before 9 o’clock, and just as I was calling the
dogs in the hall for a run, with my outdoor
things already on, Mr. Carruthers came down
the great stairs with a frown on his face.</p>

<p>“Up so early!” he said. “Are you not
going to pour out my tea for me, then?”</p>

<p>“I thought you said coffee! No, I am going
out,” and I went on down the corridor, the
wolf-hounds following me.</p>

<p>“You are not a kind hostess!” he called
after me.</p>

<p>“I am not a hostess at all,” I answered
back, “only a guest.”</p>

<p>He followed me. “Then you are a very
casual guest, not consulting the pleasure of
your host.”</p>

<p>I said nothing; I only looked at him over my
shoulder, as I went down the marble steps&mdash;looked
at him, and laughed as on the night before.</p>

<p>He turned back into the house without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
word, and I did not see him again until just
before luncheon.</p>

<p>There is something unpleasant about saying
good-bye to a place, and I found I had all sorts
of sensations rising in my throat at various
points in my walk. However, all that is
ridiculous, and must be forgotten. As I was
coming round the corner of the terrace, a great
gust of wind nearly blew me into Mr. Carruthers’
arms. Odious weather we are having
this autumn.</p>

<p>“Where have you been all the morning?”
he said, when we had recovered ourselves a
little. “I have searched for you all over the
place.”</p>

<p>“You do not know it all yet, or you would
have found me,” I said, pretending to walk on.</p>

<p>“No, you shall not go now,” he exclaimed,
pacing beside me. “Why won’t you be amiable
and make me feel at home.”</p>

<p>“I do apologize if I have been unamiable,”
I said, with great frankness. “Mrs. Carruthers
always brought me up to have such good
manners.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>After that he talked to me for half an hour
about the place.</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten his vehemence
of the night before. He asked all sorts of
questions, and showed a sentiment and a delicacy
I should not have expected from his
hard face. I was quite sorry when the gong
sounded for luncheon and we went in.</p>

<p>I have no settled plan in my head&mdash;I seem
to be drifting,&mdash;tasting for the first time some
power over another human being. It gave me
delicious thrills to see his eagerness when contrasted
with the dry refusal of my hand only
the day before.</p>

<p>At lunch I addressed myself to Mr. Barton;
he was too flattered at my attention, and continued
to chatter garrulously.</p>

<p>The rain came on, and poured, and beat
against the window-panes with a sudden angry
thud. No chance of further walks abroad. I
escaped upstairs while the butler was speaking
to Mr. Carruthers, and began helping Véronique
to pack. Chaos and desolation it all seemed in
my cosy rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>While I was on my knees in front of a great
wooden box, hopelessly trying to stow away
books, a crisp tap came to the door, and without
more ado my host&mdash;yes, he is that now&mdash;entered
the room.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! what is all this,” he exclaimed,
“what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Packing,” I said, not getting up.</p>

<p>He made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he said, “there is no need
to pack. I tell you I will not let you go. I
am going to marry you and keep you here
always.”</p>

<p>I sat down on the floor and began to laugh.</p>

<p>“You think so, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You can’t force me to marry you, you
know&mdash;can you? I want to see the world, I
don’t want any tiresome man bothering after
me. If I ever do marry it will be because&mdash;oh,
because&mdash;&mdash;” and I stopped, and began
fiddling with the cover of a book.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carruthers said it was so foolish&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I believe I should prefer to marry some one
I liked. Oh! I know you think that silly,”
and I stopped him as he was about to speak,
“but of course, as it does not last any way, it
might be good for a little to begin like that,
don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>He looked round the room, and on through
the wide open double doors into my dainty
bedroom where Véronique was still packing.</p>

<p>“You are very cosy here, it is absurd of you
to leave it,” he said.</p>

<p>I got up off the floor and went to the window
and back. I don’t know why I felt moved, a
sudden sense of the cosiness came over me.
The world looked wet and bleak outside.</p>

<p>“Why do you say you want me to marry
you, Mr. Carruthers?” I said. “You are
joking, of course.”</p>

<p>“I am not joking. I am perfectly serious.
I am ready to carry out my aunt’s wishes. It
can be no new idea to you, and you must have
worldly sense enough to realize it would be
the best possible solution of your future. I
can show you the world, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>He appeared to be extraordinarily good-looking
as he stood there, his face to the dying
light. Supposing I took him at his word, after all.</p>

<p>“But what has suddenly changed your ideas
since yesterday? You told me you had come
down to make it clear to me that you could
not possibly obey her orders.”</p>

<p>“That was yesterday,” he said. “I had not
really seen you; to-day I think differently.”</p>

<p>“It is just because you are sorry for me; I
suppose I seem so lonely,” I whispered demurely.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly impossible&mdash;what you propose
to do&mdash;to go and live by yourself at a
London hotel&mdash;the idea drives me mad!”</p>

<p>“It will be delightful! no one to order me
about from morning to night!”</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said, and he flung himself into
an armchair. “You can marry me, and I will
take you to Paris, or where you want, and I
won’t order you about,&mdash;only I shall keep the
other beasts of men from looking at you.”</p>

<p>But I told him at once I thought that would
be very dull. “I have never had the chance of
any one looking at me,” I said, “and I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
feel what it is like. Mrs. Carruthers always
assured me I was very pretty, you know, only
she said that I was certain to come to a bad end,
because of my type, unless I got married at
once, and then if my head was screwed on the
right way it would not matter; but I don’t
agree with her.”</p>

<p>He walked up and down the room impatiently.</p>

<p>“That is just it,” he said.” I would rather
be the first&mdash;I would rather you began by me.
I am strong enough to ward off the rest.”</p>

<p>“What does ’beginning by you’ mean?”
I asked with great candour. “Old Lord Bentworth
said I should begin by him, when he
was here to shoot pheasants last autumn; he
said it could not matter, he was so old; but I
didn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers bounded up from his chair.</p>

<p>“You didn’t what! Good Lord, what did
he want you to do!” he asked aghast.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, and I looked down for a
moment, I felt stupidly shy, “he wanted me
to kiss him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers appeared almost relieved, it
was strange!</p>

<p>“The old wretch! Nice company my aunt
seems to have kept!” he exclaimed. “Could
she not take better care of you than that&mdash;to
let you be insulted by her guests.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Lord Bentworth meant to
insult me. He only said he had never seen
such a red, curly mouth as mine, and as I was
bound to go to the devil some day with that,
and such hair, I might begin by kissing him&mdash;he
explained it all.”</p>

<p>“And were you not very angry?” his voice
wrathful.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not very, I could not be, I was shaking
so with laughter. If you could have seen
the silly old thing, like a wizened monkey,
with dyed hair and an eyeglass, it was too
comic!&mdash;I only told you because you said the
sentence ‘begin by you,’ and I wanted to
know if it was the same thing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers’ eyes had such a strange
expression, puzzle and amusement, and something
else. He came over close to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because,” I went on, “if so, I believe
if that is always the beginning&mdash;I don’t
want any beginnings&mdash;I haven’t the slightest
desire to kiss any one&mdash;I should simply hate
it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers laughed. “Oh! you are
only a baby child after all!” he said.</p>

<p>This annoyed me. I got up with great dignity.
“Tea will be ready in the white drawing-room,”
I said stiffly, and walked towards my
bedroom door.</p>

<p>He came after me.</p>

<p>“Send your maid away, and let us have it
up here,” he said. “I like this room.”</p>

<p>But I was not to be appeased thus easily,
and deliberately called Véronique and gave her
fresh directions.</p>

<p>“Poor old Mr. Barton will be feeling so
lonely,” I said, as I went out into the passage.
“I am going to see that he has a nice tea,” and
I looked back at Mr. Carruthers over my
shoulder. Of course he followed me and we
went together down the stairs.</p>

<p>In the hall a footman with a telegram met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
us. Mr. Carruthers tore it open impatiently.
Then he looked quite annoyed.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t mind,” he said, “but a
friend of mine, Lord Robert Vavasour is arriving
this afternoon&mdash;he is a&mdash;er&mdash;great judge
of pictures. I forgot I asked him to come down
and look at them, it clean went out of my
head.”</p>

<p>I told him he was host; and why should I
object to what guests he had.</p>

<p>“Besides, I am going myself to-morrow,”
I said, “if Véronique can get the packing done.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense&mdash;how can I make you understand
that I do not mean to let you go at all.”</p>

<p>I did not answer&mdash;only looked at him defiantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton was waiting patiently for us in
the white drawing-room, and we had not been
munching muffins for five minutes when the
sound of wheels crunching the gravel of the
great sweep&mdash;the windows of this room look
out that way&mdash;interrupted our manufactured
conversation.</p>

<p>“This must be Bob arriving,” Mr. Carruthers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
said, and went reluctantly into the hall
to meet his guest.</p>

<p>They came back together presently, and he
introduced Lord Robert to me.</p>

<p>I felt at once he was rather a pet! Such a
shape! Just like the Apollo of Belvidere! I
do love that look, with a tiny waist and nice
shoulders, and looking as if he were as lithe
as a snake, and yet could break pokers in half
like Mr. Rochester in “Jane Eyre”!</p>

<p>He has great, big, sleepy eyes of blue, and
rather a plaintive expression, and a little fairish
moustache turned up at the corners, and
the nicest mouth one ever saw, and when you
see him moving, and the back of his head, it
makes you think all the time of a beautifully
groomed thoroughbred horse. I don’t know
why. At once&mdash;in a minute&mdash;when we looked
at one another, I felt I should like “Bob”!
He has none of Mr. Carruthers’ cynical, hard,
expression, and I am sure he can’t be nearly as
old, not more than twenty-seven, or so.</p>

<p>He seemed perfectly at home, sat down and
had tea, and talked in the most casual, friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
way. Mr. Carruthers appeared to freeze up,
Mr. Barton got more banal&mdash;and the whole
thing entertained me immensely.</p>

<p>I often used to long for adventures in the
old days with Mrs. Carruthers, and here I am
really having them!</p>

<p>Such a situation! I am sure people would
think it most improper! I alone in the house
with these three men! I felt I really would
have to go&mdash;but where!</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have every intention of amusing
myself!</p>

<p>Lord Robert and I seemed to have a hundred
things to say to one another. I do like his
voice&mdash;and he is so perfectly <i>sans gêne</i>, it makes
no difficulties. By the end of tea we were as old
friends. Mr. Carruthers got more and more
polite, and stiff, and finally jumped up and
hurried his guest off to the smoking-room.</p>

<p>I put on such a duck of a frock for dinner, one
of the sweetest chastened simplicity, in black,
showing peeps of skin through the thin part at
the top. Nothing could be more demure or becoming,
and my hair would not behave, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
stuck out in rebellious waves and curls everywhere.</p>

<p>I thought it would be advisable not to be in
too good time, so sauntered down after I knew
dinner was announced.</p>

<p>They were both standing on the hearth rug. I
always forget to count Mr. Barton, he was in
some chair, I suppose, but I did not notice him.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers is the taller&mdash;about one inch;
he must be a good deal over six feet, because
the other one is very tall too, but now that
one saw them together Mr. Carruthers’ figure
appeared stiff and set beside Lord Robert’s,
and he hasn’t got nearly such a little waist. I
wonder if any other nation can have that exquisitely
<i>soigné</i> look of Englishmen in evening
dress, I don’t believe so. They really are lovely
creatures, both of them, and I don’t yet know
which I like best.</p>

<p>We had such an engaging time at dinner!
I was as provoking as I could be in the time&mdash;sympathetically
absorbingly interested in Mr.
Barton’s long stories, and only looking at the
other two now and then from under my eyelashes&mdash;while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I talked in the best demure
fashion that I am sure even Lady Katherine
Montgomerie&mdash;a neighbour of ours&mdash;would
have approved of.</p>

<p>They should not be able to say I could not
chaperone myself in any situation.</p>

<p>“Dam&mdash; good port this, Christopher,” Lord
Robert said, when the ’47 was handed round.
“Is this what you asked me down to sample?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was to give your opinion
about the pictures,” I exclaimed, surprised.
“Mr. Carruthers said you were a great judge.”</p>

<p>They looked at one another.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes,” said Lord Robert, lying
transparently. “Pictures are awfully interesting.
Will you show me them after dinner?”</p>

<p>“The light is too dim for a connoisseur to
investigate them properly,” I said.</p>

<p>“I shall have it all lit by electricity as
soon as possible; I wrote about it to-day,” Mr.
Carruthers announced, sententiously. “But
I will show you the pictures myself, to-morrow,
Bob.”</p>

<p>This at once decided me to take Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Robert round to-night, and I told him so in
a velvet voice while Mr. Barton was engaging
Christopher’s attention.</p>

<p>They stayed such a long time in the dining-room
after I left that I was on my way to bed
when they came out into the hall, and could
with difficulty be persuaded to remain for a
few moments.</p>

<p>“I am too awfully sorry!” Lord Robert
said. “I could not get away, I do not
know what possessed Christopher, he would
sample ports, and talked the hind leg off a
donkey, till at last I said to him straight out
I wanted to come to you. So here I am&mdash;now
you won’t go to bed, will you&mdash;please,
please.”</p>

<p>He has such pleading blue eyes&mdash;imploring
pathetically like a baby in distress&mdash;it is quite
impossible to resist him! and we started down
the gallery.</p>

<p>Of course he did not know the difference
between a Canaletto and a Turner, and hardly
made a pretence of being interested, in fact
when we got to the end where the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Italians hang, and I was explaining the wonderful
texture of a Madonna, he said:</p>

<p>“They all look sea-sick, and out of shape!
don’t you think we might sit in that comfy
window seat and talk of something else!”
Then he told me he loved pictures, but not
this sort.</p>

<p>“I like people to look human you know,
even on canvas,” he said. “All these ladies
appear as if they were getting enteric like people
used in Africa, and I don’t like their halos, and
things, and all the men are old and bald. But
you must not think me a Goth&mdash;you will teach
me their points, won’t you, and then I shall
love them.”</p>

<p>I said I did not care a great deal for them
myself, except the colour.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so glad,” he said. “I should
like to find we admired the same things; but
no picture could interest me as much as your
hair. It is the loveliest thing I have ever seen,
and you do it so beautifully.”</p>

<p>That did please me! He has the most
engaging ways, Lord Robert, and he is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
well informed, not stupid a bit, or thick,
only absolutely simple and direct. We talked
softly together, quite happy for a while.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Carruthers got rid of Mr. Barton,
and came towards us. I settled myself more
comfortably on the velvet cushions. Purple
velvet cushions and curtains in this gallery,
good old relics of early Victorian taste. Lots
of the house is awful, but these curtains always
please me.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers’ face was as stern as a stone
bust of Augustus Caesar. I am sure the monks
in the Inquisition looked like that. I do
wonder what he meant to say, but Lord
Robert did not give him time.</p>

<p>“Do go away, Christopher,” he said; “Miss
Travers is going to teach me things about
Italian Madonnas, and I can’t keep my attention
if there is a third person about.”</p>

<p>I suppose if Mr. Carruthers had not been a
diplomat he would have sworn, but I believe
that kind of education makes you able to put
your face how you like, so he smiled sweetly,
and took a chair near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall not leave you, Bob,” he said. “I do
not consider you are a good companion for
Miss Evangeline. I am responsible for her,
and I am going to take care of her.”</p>

<p>“Then you should not have asked him here
if he is not a respectable person,” I said,
innocently; “but Italian Madonnas ought to
chasten and elevate his thoughts. Anyway
your responsibility towards me is self constituted.
I am the only person whom I mean
to obey!” and I settled myself deliberately in
the velvet pillows.</p>

<p>“Not a good companion!” exclaimed Lord
Robert, “What dam&mdash; cheek, Christopher. I
have not my equal in the whole Household
Cavalry, as you know.”</p>

<p>They both laughed, and we continued to
talk in a sparring way, Mr. Carruthers sharp,
subtle, and fine as a sword blade&mdash;Lord Robert
downright, simple, with an air of a puzzled
baby.</p>

<p>When I thought they were both wanting me
very much to stay, I got up, and said good-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>They both came down the gallery with me,
and insisted upon each lighting a candle from
the row of burnished silver candlesticks in the
hall, which they presented to me with great
mock homage. It annoyed me, I don’t know
why, and I suddenly froze up, and declined
them both, while I said good-night again stiffly,
and walked in my most stately manner up the
stairs.</p>

<p>I could see Lord Robert’s eyebrows puckered
into a more plaintive expression than ever, while
he let the beautiful silver candlestick hang,
dropping the grease on to the polished oak floor.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers stood quite still, and put his
light back on the table. His face was cynical
and rather amused. I can’t say what irritation
I felt, and immediately decided to leave on the
morrow&mdash;but where to, Fate, or the Devil,
could only know!</p>

<p>When I got to my room a lump came in
my throat. Véronique had gone to bed, tired
out with her day’s packing.</p>

<p>I suddenly felt utterly alone, all the exaltation
gone. For the moment I hated the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
downstairs. I felt the situation equivocal, and
untenable, and it had amused me so much an
hour ago.</p>

<p>It is stupid and silly, and makes one’s nose
red, but I felt like crying a little before I got
into bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr6 p1"><span class="smcap">Branches</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2 "><i>Saturday afternoon, Nov. 5th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="smcap">This</span></span> morning I woke with a headache, to
see the rain beating against my windows, and
mist and fog&mdash;a fitting day for the fifth of
November. I would not go down to breakfast.
Véronique brought me mine to my sitting-room
fire, and, with Spartan determination, I packed
steadily all the morning.</p>

<p>About twelve a note came up from Lord
Robert; I paste it in:</p>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Travers</span>,&mdash;Why are you
hiding? Was I a bore last night? Do forgive
me and come down. Has Christopher locked
you in your room? I will murder the brute if
he has!</p>

<p class="pr4">“Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Robert Vavasour</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Can’t, I am packing,” I scribbled in pencil
on the envelope, and gave it back to Charles,
who was waiting in the hall for the answer.
Two minutes after Lord Robert walked into
the room, the door of which the footman had
left open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have come to help you,” he said in that
voice of his that sounds so sure of a welcome
you can’t snub him; “but where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said, a little forlornly,
and then bent down and vigorously collected
photographs.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you can’t go to London by yourself!”
he said, aghast. “Look here, I will
come up with you, and take you to my aunt,
Lady Merrenden. She is such a dear, and I
am sure when I have told her all about you
she will be delighted to take care of you for
some days until you can hunt round.”</p>

<p>He looked such a boy, and his face was so
kind, I was touched.</p>

<p>“Oh no, Lord Robert! I cannot do that,
but I thank you. I don’t want to be under an
obligation to any one,” I said firmly. “Mr.
Carruthers suggests a way out of the difficulty&mdash;that
I should marry him, and stay here. I
don’t think he means it really, but he pretends
he does.”</p>

<p>He sat down on the edge of a table already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
laden with books, most of which overbalanced
and fell crash on the floor.</p>

<p>“So Christopher wants you to marry him,
the old fox!” he said, apparently oblivious of
the wreck of literature he had caused. “But
you won’t do that, will you? And yet I have
no business to say that. He is a dam&mdash; good
friend, Christopher.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you ought not to swear so often,
Lord Robert, it shocks me, brought up as I
have been,” I said, with the air of a little angel.</p>

<p>“Do I swear?” he asked, surprised. “Oh
no, I don’t think so&mdash;at least there is no ‘n’
to the end of the ‘dams,’ so they are only an
innocent ornament to conversation. But I
won’t do it, if you don’t wish me to.”</p>

<p>After that he helped me with the books, and
was so merry and kind I soon felt cheered up,
and by lunch time all were finished, and in the
boxes ready to be tied up, and taken away.
Véronique, too, had made great progress in the
adjoining room, and was standing stiff and
<i>maussade</i> by my dressing-table when I came in.
She spoke respectfully in French, and asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
me if I had made my plans yet, for, as she explained
to me, her own position seemed precarious,
and yet having been with me for five
years, she did not feel she could leave me at a
juncture like this. At the same time she hoped
Mademoiselle would make some suitable decision,
as she feared (respectfully) it was “<i>une
si drole de position pour une demoiselle du monde</i>,”
alone with “<i>ces messieurs</i>.”</p>

<p>I could not be angry, it was quite true what
she said.</p>

<p>“I shall go up this evening to Claridge’s,
Véronique,” I assured her, “by about the 5.15
train. We will wire to them after luncheon.”</p>

<p>She seemed comforted, but she added, in the
abstract, that a rich marriage was what was
obviously Mademoiselle’s fate, and she felt
sure great happiness and many jewels would
await Mademoiselle, if Mademoiselle could be
persuaded to make up her mind. Nothing is
sacred to one’s maid! She knew all about Mr.
Carruthers, of course. Poor old Véronique&mdash;I
have a big, warm corner for her in my heart&mdash;sometimes
she treats me with the frigid respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
one would pay to a queen, and at others
I am almost her <i>enfant</i>, so tender and motherly
she is to me. And she puts up with all my
tempers and moods, and pets me like a baby
just when I am the worst of all.</p>

<p>Lord Robert had left me reluctantly when
the luncheon gong sounded.</p>

<p>“Haven’t we been happy?” he said, taking
it for granted I felt the same as he did. This
is a very engaging quality of his, and makes
one feel sympathetic, especially when he looks
into one’s eyes with his sleepy blue ones. He
has lashes as long and curly as a gipsy’s baby.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers was alone in the dining-room
when I got in; he was looking out of the
window, and turned round sharply as I came
up the room. I am sure he would like to have
been killing flies on the panes if he had been a
boy! His eyes were steel.</p>

<p>“Where have you been all the time?” he
asked, when he had shaken hands and said good-morning.</p>

<p>“Up in my room packing,” I said simply.
“Lord Robert was so kind, he helped me&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have got everything done, and may I order the
carriage for the 5.15 train, please?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not&mdash;confound Lord Robert!”
Mr. Carruthers said. “What business is it of
his? You are not to go. I won’t let you.
Dear, silly, little child&mdash;” his voice was quite
moved. “You can’t possibly go out into the
world all alone. Evangeline, why won’t you
marry me? I&mdash;do you know, I believe&mdash;I shall
love you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should have to be <i>perfectly sure</i> that the
person I married loved me, Mr. Carruthers,”
I said, demurely, “before I consented to finish
up my life like that.”</p>

<p>He had no time to answer, for Mr. Barton
and Lord Robert came into the room.</p>

<p>There seemed a gloom over luncheon. There
were pauses, and Lord Robert had a more
pathetic expression than ever. His hands are
a nice shape&mdash;but so are Mr. Carruthers’, they
both look very much like gentlemen.</p>

<p>Before we had finished, a note was brought
in to me. It was from Lady Katherine Montgomerie.
She was too sorry, she said, to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of my lonely position, and she was writing to
ask if I would not come over and spend a fortnight
with them at Tryland Court.</p>

<p>It was not well worded, and I had never
cared much for Lady Katherine, but it was
fairly kind, and fitted in perfectly with my
plans.</p>

<p>She had probably heard of Mr. Carruthers’
arrival, and was scandalized at my being alone
in the house with him.</p>

<p>Both men had their eyes fixed on my face
when I looked up, as I finished reading the
note.</p>

<p>“Lady Katherine Montgomerie writes to
ask me to Tryland,” I said; “so if you will
excuse me I will answer it, and say I will come
this afternoon,”&mdash;and I got up.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers rose too, and followed me
into the library. He deliberately shut the door
and came over to the writing-table where I sat
down.</p>

<p>“Well, if I let you go, will you tell her then
that you are engaged to me, and I am going to
marry you as soon as possible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed I won’t!” I said, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I am not going to marry you, or any one,
Mr. Carruthers. What do you think of me&mdash;!
Fancy my consenting to come back here for
ever, and live with you&mdash;when I don’t know
you a bit&mdash;and having to put up with your&mdash;perhaps&mdash;kissing
me, and, and&mdash;things of that
sort! It is perfectly dreadful to think of!”</p>

<p>He laughed as if in spite of himself. “But
supposing I promised not to kiss you&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Even so,” I said, and I couldn’t help biting
the end of my pen, “it could happen that I
might get a feeling I wanted to kiss some one
else&mdash;and there it is! Once you’re married,
everything nice is wrong!”</p>

<p>“Evangeline! I won’t let you go&mdash;out of
my life&mdash;you strange little witch, you have
upset me, disturbed me, I can settle to nothing.
I seem to want you so very much.”</p>

<p>“Pouff!” I said, and I pouted at him.</p>

<p>“You have everything in your life to fill it&mdash;position,
riches, friends&mdash;you don’t want a
green-eyed adventuress.”</p>

<p>I bent down and wrote steadily to Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Katherine. I would be there about 6 o’clock,
I said, and thanked her in my best style.</p>

<p>“If I let you go, it is only for the time,”
Mr. Carruthers said, as I signed my name. “I
<i>intend</i> you to marry me&mdash;do you hear!”</p>

<p>“Again I say <i>qui vivra verra</i>!” I laughed,
and rose with the note in my hand.</p>

<p>Lord Robert looked almost ready to cry
when I told him I was off in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I shall see you again,” he said. “Lady
Katherine is a relation of my aunt’s husband,
Lord Merrenden. I don’t know her myself,
though.”</p>

<p>I do not believe him&mdash;how can he see me
again&mdash;young men do talk a lot of nonsense.</p>

<p>“I shall come over on Wednesday to see
how you are getting on,” Mr. Carruthers said.
“Please do be in.”</p>

<p>I promised I would, and then I came upstairs.</p>

<p>And so it has come to an end, my life at
Branches. I am going to start a new phase of
existence, my first beginning as an adventuress!</p>

<p>How completely all one’s ideas can change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in a few days. This day three weeks ago Mrs.
Carruthers was alive. This day two weeks ago I
found myself no longer a prospective heiress&mdash;and
only three days ago I was contemplating
calmly the possibility of marrying Mr. Carruthers&mdash;and
now&mdash;for heaven&mdash;I would not
marry any one! And so, for fresh woods and
pastures new. Oh! I want to see the world,
and lots of different human beings&mdash;I want to
know what it is makes the clock go round&mdash;that
great, big, clock of life&mdash;I want to dance,
and to sing, and to laugh, and to <i>live</i>&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps
some day to kiss some one
I love&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 p1"><span class="smcap">Tryland Court, Headington</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Wednesday, November 9th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goodness</span> gracious! I have been here four
whole days, and I continually ask myself how
I shall be able to stand it for the rest of the
fortnight. Before I left Branches I began to
have a sinking at the heart. There were
horribly touching farewells with housekeepers
and people I have known since a child, and
one hates to have that choky feeling&mdash;especially
as just at the end of it&mdash;while tears were
still in my eyes, Mr. Carruthers came out
into the hall, and saw them&mdash;so did Lord
Robert!</p>

<p>I blinked, and blinked, but one would trickle
down my nose. It was a horribly awkward
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers made profuse inquiries as to
my comforts for the drive, in a tone colder than
ever, and insisted upon my drinking some
cherry brandy. Such fussing is quite unlike
his usual manner, so I suppose he too felt it
was a tiresome <i>quart d’heure</i>. Lord Robert did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
not hide his concern, he came up to me and
took my hand while Christopher was speaking
to the footman who was going with me.</p>

<p>“You are a dear,” he said, “and a brick,
and don’t you forget I shall come and stay
with Lady Katherine before you leave, so you
won’t feel you are all among strangers.”</p>

<p>I thanked him, and he squeezed my hand
so kindly&mdash;I do like Lord Robert.</p>

<p>Very soon I was gay again, and <i>insouciante</i>,
and the last they saw of me was smiling out of
the brougham window as I drove off in the
dusk. They both stood upon the steps and
waved to me.</p>

<p>Tea was over at Tryland when I arrived,
such a long, damp drive! And I explained to
Lady Katherine how sorry I was to have had
to come so late, and that I could not think of
troubling her to have up fresh for me&mdash;but
she insisted, and after a while a whole new
lot came, made in a hurry with the water not
boiling, and I had to gulp down a nasty cup&mdash;Ceylon
tea, too&mdash;I hate Ceylon tea! Mr. Montgomerie
warmed himself before the fire, quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
shielding it from us, who shivered on a row
of high-backed chairs beyond the radius of the
hearth rug.</p>

<p>He has a way of puffing out his cheeks
and making a noise like “Bur-r-r-r”&mdash;which
sounds very bluff and hearty, until you find
he has said a mean thing about some one
directly after. And while red hair looks very
well on me, I do think a man with it is the
ugliest thing in creation. His face is red, and
his nose and cheeks almost purple, and fiery
whiskers, fierce enough to frighten a cat in a
dark lane.</p>

<p>He was a rich Scotch manufacturer, and poor
Lady Katherine had to marry him, I suppose,
though, as she is Scotch herself, I daresay she
does not notice that he is rather coarse.</p>

<p>There are two sons and six daughters, one
married, four grown-up, and one at school in
Brussels, and all with red hair!&mdash;but straight
and coarse, and with freckles and white eyelashes.
So really it is very kind of Lady
Katherine to have asked me here.</p>

<p>They are all as good as gold on top, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
does poker work, and another binds books
and a third embroiders altar-cloths, and the
fourth knits ties&mdash;all for charities, and they
ask everyone to subscribe to them directly they
come to the house. The tie and the altar-cloth
one were sitting working hard in the drawing-room&mdash;Kirstie
and Jean are their names&mdash;Jessie
and Maggie, the poker worker and the
bookbinder have a sitting-room to themselves,
their workshop they call it. They were there
still, I suppose, for I did not see them until
dinner. We used to meet once a year at Mrs.
Carruthers’ Christmas parties ever since ages
and ages, and I remember I hated their tartan
sashes, and they generally had colds in their
heads, and one year they gave every one mumps,
so they were not asked the next. The altar-cloth
one, Jean, is my age, the other three are
older.</p>

<p>It was really very difficult to find something
to say, and I can quite understand common
people fidgeting when they feel worried like
this. I have never fidgeted since eight years
ago, the last time Mrs. Carruthers boxed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ears for it. Just before going up to dress for
dinner Mr. Montgomerie asked blank out if
it was true that Mr. Carruthers had arrived.
Lady Katherine had been skirting round this
subject for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>I only said yes, but that was not enough,
and once started, he asked a string of questions,
with “Bur-r-r-r” several times in between.
Was Mr. Carruthers going to shoot the pheasants
in November? Had he decided to keep
on the <i>chef</i>? Had he given up diplomacy? I
said I really did not know any of these things,
I had seen so little of him.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine nodded her head, while she
measured a comforter she was knitting to see
if it was long enough.</p>

<p>“I am sure it must have been most awkward
for you, his arriving at all; it was not very
good taste on his part, I am afraid, but I suppose
he wished to see his inheritance as soon
as possible,” she said.</p>

<p>I nearly laughed, thinking what she would
say if she knew which part of his inheritance
he had really come to see. I do wonder if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
has ever heard that Mrs. Carruthers left me to
him, more or less, in her will!</p>

<p>“I hope you had your old governess with
you, at least,” she continued, as we went up
the stairs, “so that you could feel less uncomfortable&mdash;really
a most shocking situation for
a girl alone in the house with an unmarried
man.”</p>

<p>I told her Mr. Barton was there too, but I
had not the courage to say anything about Lord
Robert; only that Mr. Carruthers had a friend
of his down, who was a great judge of pictures,
to see them.</p>

<p>“Oh! a valuer, I suppose. I hope he is not
going to sell the Correggios!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” I said, leaving the
part about the valuer unanswered.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers, being unmarried, seemed to
worry her most; she went on about it again
before we got to my bedroom door.</p>

<p>“I happened to hear a rumour at Miss
Sheriton’s (the wool shop in Headington, our
town), this morning,” she said, “and so I
wrote at once to you. I felt how terrible it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
would be for one of my own dear girls to be
left alone with a bachelor like that&mdash;I almost
wonder you did not stay up in your own
rooms.”</p>

<p>I thanked her for her kind thought, and she
left me at last!</p>

<p>If she only knew! The unmarried ones who
came down the passage to talk to Mademoiselle
were not half so saucy as the old fellows
with wives somewhere. Lord Bentworth was
married, and he wanted me to kiss him, whereas
Colonel Grimston had no wife, and he never
said bo! to a goose! And I do wonder what
she thought Mr. Carruthers was going to do
to me, that it would have been wiser for me
to stay up in my rooms. Perhaps she thinks
diplomats, having lived in foreign places, are
sort of wild beasts.</p>

<p>My room is frightful after my pretty rosy
chintzes at Branches. Nasty yellowish wood
furniture, and nothing much matching; however
there are plenty of wardrobes, so Véronique
is content.</p>

<p>They were all in the drawing-room when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
got down, and Malcolm, the eldest son, who
is in a Highland Militia regiment, had arrived
by a seven o’clock train.</p>

<p>I had that dreadful feeling of being very
late, and Mr. Montgomerie wanting to swear
at me, though it was only a minute past a
quarter to eight.</p>

<p>He said “Bur-r-r-r” several times, and flew
off to the dining-room with me tucked under
his arm, murmuring it gave no cook a chance
to keep the dinner waiting! So I expected
something wonderful in the way of food, but
it is not half so good as our <i>chef</i> gave us at
Branches. And the footmen are not all the
same height, and their liveries don’t fit like
Mrs. Carruthers always insisted that ours
should do.</p>

<p>Malcolm <i>is</i> a tittsy-pootsy man! Not as tall
as I am, and thin as a rail, with a look of his
knees being too near together. He must be
awful in a kilt, and I am sure he shivers when
the wind blows, he has that air. I don’t like
kilts, unless men are big, strong, bronzed
creatures who don’t seem ashamed of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
bare bits. I saw some splendid specimens
marching once in Edinburgh, and they swung
their skirts just like the beautiful ladies in the
Bois, when Mademoiselle and I went out of
the Allée Mrs. Carruthers told us to try always
to walk in.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine talked a great deal at dinner
about politics, and her different charities, and
the four girls were so respectful and interested,
but Mr. Montgomerie contradicted her whenever
he could. I was glad when we went into
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>That first evening was the worst of all,
because we were all so strange; one seems to
get acclimatized to whatever it is after a
while.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine asked me if I had not some
fancy work to do. Kirstie had begun her ties,
and Jean the altar-cloth again.</p>

<p>“Do let Maggie run to your room and
fetch it for you,” she said.</p>

<p>I was obliged to tell her I never did any.
“But I&mdash;I can trim hats,” I said. It really
seemed so awful not to be able to do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
like them, I felt I must say this as a kind of
defence for myself.</p>

<p>However, she seemed to think that hardly
a lady’s employment.</p>

<p>“How clever of you!” Kirstie exclaimed.
“I wish I could; but don’t you find that
intermittent? You can’t trim them all the time.
Don’t you feel the want of a constant employment?”</p>

<p>I was obliged to say I had not felt like that
yet, but I could not tell them I particularly
loved sitting perfectly still, doing nothing.</p>

<p>Jessie and Maggie played Patience at two
tables which folded up, and which they brought
out, and sat down to with a deliberate accustomed
look, which made me know at once they
did this every night, and that I should see
those tables planted exactly on those two spots
of carpet each evening during my whole stay.
I suppose it is because they cannot bring the
poker work and the bookbinding into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Won’t you play us something?” Lady
Katherine asked, plaintively. Evidently it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
not permitted to do nothing, so I got up and
went to the piano.</p>

<p>Fortunately I know heaps of things by heart,
and I love them, and would have gone on, and
on, so as to fill up the time, but they all said
“thank you” in a chorus after each bit, and it
rather put me off.</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomerie and Malcolm did not
come in for ages, and I could see Lady
Katherine getting uneasy. One or two things
at dinner suggested to me that these two were
not on the best terms, perhaps she feared they
had come to blows in the dining-room. The
Scotch, Mrs. Carruthers said, have all kinds of
rough customs that other nations do not keep
up any longer.</p>

<p>They did turn up at last, and Mr. Montgomerie
was purple all over his face, and
Malcolm a pale green, but there were no
bruises on him; only one could see they had
had a terrible quarrel.</p>

<p>There is something in breeding after all,
even if one is of a barbarous country. Lady
Katherine behaved so well, and talked charities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and politics faster than ever, and did not give
them time for any further outburst, though I
fancy I heard a few “dams” mixed with the
“bur-r-r-rs,” and not without the “n” on just
for ornament, like Lord Robert’s.</p>

<p>It was a frightful evening.</p>


<p class="pr2 p2"><i>Wednesday, Nov. 9th (continued).</i></p>

<p>Malcolm walked beside me going to church
the next day. He looked a little less depressed
and I tried to cheer him up.</p>

<p>He did not tell me what his worries were,
but Jean had said something about it when she
came into my room as I was getting ready. It
appears he has got into trouble over a horse
called Angela Grey. Jean gathered this from
Lady Katherine, she said her father was very
angry about it, as he had spent so much money
on it.</p>

<p>To me it does not sound like a horse’s name,
and I told Jean so, but she was perfectly
horrified, and said it must be a horse, because
they were not acquainted with any Angela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Grey, and did not even know any Greys at all:
so it must be a horse!</p>

<p>I think that a ridiculous reason, as Mrs.
Carruthers said all young men knew people
one wouldn’t want to&mdash;and it was silly to make
a fuss about it&mdash;and that they couldn’t help
it&mdash;and they would be very dull if they were
as good as gold like girls.</p>

<p>But I expect Lady Katherine thinks differently
about things to Mrs. Carruthers, and the
daughters are the same.</p>

<p>I shall ask Lord Robert when I see him
again if it is a horse or no.</p>

<p>Malcolm is not attractive, and I was glad the
church was not far off.</p>

<p>No carriages are allowed out on Sunday, so
we had to walk, and coming back it began to
rain, and we could not go round the stables,
which I understand is the custom here every
Sunday.</p>

<p>Everything is done because it is the custom&mdash;not
because you want to amuse yourself.</p>

<p>“When it rains and we can’t go round the
stables,” Kirstie said, “we look at the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
‘Illustrated London News,’ and go there on
our way from afternoon church.”</p>

<p>I did not particularly want to do that, so
stayed in my room as long as I could. The
four girls were seated at a large table in the
hall, each with a volume in front of her when
I got down at last. They must know every
picture by heart, if they do it every Sunday it
rains&mdash;they stay in England all the winter!</p>

<p>Jean made room for me beside her.</p>

<p>“I am at the ‘Sixties,’” she said. “I finished
the ‘Fifties’ last Easter.” So they
evidently do even this with a method.</p>

<p>I asked her if there were not any new books
they wanted to read, but she said Lady
Katherine did not care for their looking at
magazines or novels unless she had been
through them first, and she had not time for
many, so they kept the few they had to read
between tea and dinner on Sunday.</p>

<p>By this time I felt I should do something
wicked; and if the luncheon gong had not
sounded, I do not know what would have
happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Montgomerie said rather gallant things
to me when the cheese and port came along,
while the girls looked shocked, and Lady
Katherine had a stony stare. I suppose he is
like this because he is married. I wonder,
though, if young married men are the same, I
have never met any yet.</p>

<p>By Monday night I was beginning to feel
the end of the world would come soon! It is
ten times worse than even having had to conceal
all my feelings, and abjectly obey Mrs.
Carruthers. Because she did say cynical, entertaining
things sometimes to me, and to her
friends, that made one laugh. And one felt it
was only she who made the people who were
dependent upon her do her way, because she,
herself, was so selfish, and that the rest of the
world were free if once one got outside.</p>

<p>But Lady Katherine, and the whole Montgomerie
<i>milieu</i>, give you the impression that
everything and everybody must be ruled by
rules; and no one could have a right to an
individual opinion in any sphere of society.</p>

<p>You simply can’t laugh, they asphyxiate you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I am looking forward to this afternoon, and
Mr. Carruthers coming over. I often think of
the days at Branches, and how exciting it was,
with those two, and I wish I were back again.</p>

<p>I have tried to be polite and nice to them
all here, and yet they don’t seem absolutely
pleased.</p>

<p>Malcolm gazes at me with sheep’s eyes.
They are a washy blue, with the family white
eyelashes (how different to Lord Robert’s!). He
has the most precise, regulated manner, and
never says a word of slang, he ought to have
been a young curate, and I can’t imagine him
spending his money on any Angela Greys, even
if she is a horse or not.</p>

<p>He speaks to me when he can, and asks me
to go for walks round the golf course. The
four girls play for an hour and three-quarters
every morning. They never seem to enjoy
anything&mdash;the whole of life is a solid duty. I
am sitting up in my room, and Véronique has
had the sense to have my fire lighted early. I
suppose Mr. Carruthers won’t come until about
four, an hour more to be got through. I have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
I must write letters, and so have escaped from
them, and not had to go for the usual drive.</p>

<p>I suppose he will have the sense to ask for
me, even if Lady Katherine is not back when
he comes.</p>

<p>This morning it was so fine and frosty a kind
of devil seemed to creep into me. I have been
<i>so</i> good since Saturday, so when Malcolm said,
in his usual prim, priggish voice, “Miss
Travers, may I have the pleasure of taking you
for a little exercise,” I jumped up without consulting
Lady Katherine, and went and put my
things on, and we started.</p>

<p>I had a feeling that they were all thinking I
was doing something wrong, and so, of course,
it made me worse. I said every kind of simple
thing I could to Malcolm to make him jump,
and looked at him now and then from under
my eyelashes. So when we got to a stile, he
did want to help me! and his eyes were quite
wobblish! He has a giggle right up in the
treble, and it comes out at such unexpected
moments, when there is nothing to laugh at. I
suppose it is being Scotch, he has just caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the meaning of some former joke. There would
never be any use in saying things to him like
to Lord Robert and Mr. Carruthers, because
one would have left the place before he understood,
if even then.</p>

<p>There was an old Sir Thomas Farquharson
who came to Branches, and he grasped the
deepest jokes of Mrs. Carruthers, so deep that
even I did not understand them, and he was
Scotch. It may be they are like that only when
they have red hair.</p>

<p>When I was seated on top of a stile, Malcolm
suddenly announced, “I hear you are going to
London when you go. I hope you will let me
come and see you, but I wish you lived here
always.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” I said, and then I remembered
that sounded rather rude, and they had been
kind to me. “At least&mdash;you know, I think
the country is dull&mdash;don’t you&mdash;for always?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, primly, “for men, but it
is where I should always wish to see the woman
I respected.”</p>

<p>“Are towns so wicked?” I asked, in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
little angel voice. “Tell me of their pitfalls,
so that I may avoid them.”</p>

<p>“You must not believe everything people
say to you, to begin with,” he said, seriously.
“For one so young as you, I am afraid you
will find your path beset with temptations.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do tell me what!” I implored. “I
have always wanted to know what temptations
were. Please tell me. If you come to see me&mdash;would
you be a temptation, or is temptation
a thing, and not a person?” I looked at him
so beseechingly, he never for a second saw the
twinkle in my eye!</p>

<p>He coughed pompously. “I expect I should
be,” he said, modestly. “Temptations are&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Oh!
I say, you know, I say&mdash;I don’t
know what to say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a pity!” I said, regretfully. “I
was hoping to hear all about it from you&mdash;specially
if you are one yourself, you must
know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He looked gratified, but still confused.</p>

<p>“You see when you are quite alone in London,
some man may make love to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! do you think so <i>really</i>?” I asked,
aghast. “That, I suppose would be frightful,
if I were by myself in the room! Would it be
all right, do you think, if I left the sitting-room
door open, and kept Véronique on the
other side?”</p>

<p>He looked at me hard, but he only saw the
face of an unprotected angel, and, becoming
reassured, he said gravely,</p>

<p>“Yes, it might be just as well!”</p>

<p>“You do surprise me about love,” I said.
“I had no idea it was a violent kind of thing
like that. I thought it began with grave reverence
and respect&mdash;and after years of offering
flowers and humble compliments, and bread
and butter at tea-parties, the gentleman went
down upon one knee and made a declaration&mdash;‘Clara,
Maria, I adore you, be mine,’ and then
one put out a lily-white hand, and, blushing,
told him to rise&mdash;but that can’t be your sort,
and you have not yet explained what temptation
means?”</p>

<p>“It means more or less wanting to do what
you ought not to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, then!” I said, “I am having temptation
all the time, aren’t you? For instance, I
want to tear up Jean’s altar-cloths, and rip
Kirstie’s ties, and tool bad words on Jessie’s
bindings, and burn Maggie’s wood boxes!”</p>

<p>He looked horribly shocked&mdash;and hurt&mdash;so
I added at once&mdash;</p>

<p>“Of course it must be lovely to be able to
do these things, they are perfect girls, and so
clever&mdash;only it makes me feel like that because
I suppose I am&mdash;different.”</p>

<p>He looked at me critically. “Yes, you are
different, I wish you would try to be more
like my sisters&mdash;then I should not feel so nervous
about your going to London.</p>

<p>“It is too good of you to worry,” I said,
demurely; “but I don’t think you need, you
know! I have rather a strong suspicion I am
acquainted with the way to take care of myself!”
and I bent down and laughed right in
his face, and jumped off the stile on to the
other side.</p>

<p>He did look such a teeny shrimp climbing
after me! but it does not matter what is their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
size, the vanity of men is just the same. I am
sure he thought he had only to begin making
love to me himself, and I would drop like a
ripe peach into his mouth.</p>

<p>I teased him all the way back, until when
we got into lunch he did not know whether
he was on his head or his heels! Just as we
came up to the door, he said:</p>

<p>“I thought your name was Evangeline&mdash;why
did you say it was Clara Maria?”</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;it is not!!” I laughed over my
shoulder, and ran into the house.</p>

<p>He stood on the steps, and if he had been
one of the stable boys he would have scratched
his head.</p>

<p>Now I must stop and dress. I shall put on a
black tea frock I have. Mr. Carruthers shall see
I have not caught frumpdom from my hosts!</p>


<p class="pr2 p2"><i>Night.</i></p>

<p>I do think men are the most horrid creatures,
you can’t believe what they say, or rely upon
them for five minutes! Mrs. Carruthers was
right, she said, “Evangeline, remember, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
quite difficult enough to trust oneself, without
trusting a man.”</p>

<p>Such an afternoon I have had! That annoying
feeling of waiting for something all the
time, and nothing happening. For Mr. Carruthers
did not turn up after all! How I wish
I had not dressed and expected him.</p>

<p>He is probably saying to himself he is well
out of the business&mdash;now I have gone. I don’t
suppose he meant a word of his protestations
to me. Well, he need not worry! I had no
intention of jumping down his throat&mdash;only I
would have been glad to see him because he is
human, and not like any one here.</p>

<p>Of course Lord Robert will be the same,
and I shall probably never see either of them
again. How can Lord Robert get here, when he
does not know Lady Katherine. No, it was just
said to say something nice when I was leaving,
and he will be as horrid as Mr. Carruthers.</p>

<p>I am thankful at least that I did not tell Lady
Katherine, I should have felt such a goose.
Oh! I do wonder what I shall do next. I
don’t know at all how much things cost&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
three hundred a year is very poor. I am
sure my best frocks always were five or six
hundred francs each, and I daresay hotels run
away with money. But, for the moment, I am
rich, as Mr. Barton kindly advanced some of
my legacy to me, and oh! I am going to see
life! and it is absurd to be sad! I shall go to
bed, and forget how cross I feel!</p>

<p>They are going to have a shoot here next
week&mdash;Pheasants. I wonder if they will have
a lot of old men. I have not heard all who are
coming.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine said to me after dinner this
evening that she was sorry as she was afraid it
would be most awkward for me their having
a party, on account of my deep mourning, and
I, if I felt it dreadfully, I need not consider
they would find me the least rude if I preferred
to have dinner in my room!</p>

<p>I don’t want to have dinner in my room!
Think of the stuffiness of it! and perhaps
hearing laughter going on downstairs.</p>

<p>I can always amuse myself watching faces,
however dull they are. I thanked her, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it would not be at all necessary, as I must get
accustomed to seeing people, I could not count
upon always meeting hostesses with such kind
thoughts as hers, and I might as well get used
to it.</p>

<p>She said yes, but not cordially.</p>

<p>To-morrow Mrs. Mackintosh, the eldest
daughter, is arriving with her four children.
I remember her wedding five years ago. I have
never seen her since.</p>

<p>She was very tall and thin, and stooped
dreadfully, and Mrs. Carruthers said Providence
had been very kind in giving her a husband
at all. But when Mr. Mackintosh trotted
down the aisle with her, I did not think so!</p>

<p>A wee sandy fellow about up to her
shoulder!</p>

<p>Oh, I would hate to be tied to that! I think
to be tied to anything could not be very nice.
I wonder how I ever thought of marrying Mr.
Carruthers off hand!</p>

<p>I feel now I shall never marry&mdash;for years.
Of course, one can’t be an old maid! But for
a long time I mean to see life first.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>This</i> is what I get this morning! Pig!</p>

<p>Well, I sha’n’t be in if he does come&mdash;I
can just see him pulling himself together once
temptation (it makes me think of Malcolm!),
is out of his way; he no doubt feels he has had
an escape, as I am nobody very grand.</p>

<p>The letters come early here, as everywhere,
but in a bag which only Mr. Montgomerie
can open, and one has to wait until everyone
is seated at breakfast before he produces the
key, and deals them all out.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers’ was the only one for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and it had “Branches” on the envelope, which
attracted Mr. Montgomerie’s attention, and he
began to “Bur-r-r-r,” and hardly gave me time
to read it before he commenced to ask questions
<i>à propos</i> of the place, to get me to say
what the letter was about. He is a curious
man.</p>

<p>“Carruthers is a capital fellow, they tell me&mdash;er&mdash;You
had better ask him over quietly,
Katherine, if he is all alone at Branches”&mdash;this
with one eye on me in a questioning
way.</p>

<p>I remained silent.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is off to London, though?”</p>

<p>I pretended to be busy with my coffee.</p>

<p>“Best pheasant shoot in the county, and a
close borough under the old <i>régime</i>; hope he
will be more neighbourly&mdash;er&mdash;suppose he
must shoot ’em before December?”</p>

<p>I buttered my toast.</p>

<p>Then the “Bur-r-r-rs” began!! I wonder
he does not have a noise that ends with d&mdash;n
simply, it would save him time!</p>

<p>“Couldn’t help seeing your letter was from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Branches. Hope Carruthers gives you some
news?”</p>

<p>As he addressed me deliberately I was obliged
to answer:</p>

<p>“I have no information. It is only a business
letter,” and I ate toast again.</p>

<p>He “bur-r-r-r-d” more than ever, and
opened some of his own correspondence.</p>

<p>“What am I to do, Katherine?” he said,
presently; “that confounded fellow Campion
has thrown me over for next week, and he is
my best gun: at short notice like this, it’s impossible
to replace him with the same class of
shot.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Lady Katherine, in that
kind of voice that has not heard the question&mdash;she
was deep in her own letters.</p>

<p>“Katherine!” roared Mr. Montgomerie.
“Will you listen when I speak&mdash;Bur-r-r-r!”
and he thumped his fist on the table.</p>

<p>Poor Lady Katherine almost jumped, and
the china rattled.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Anderson,” she said, humbly,
“you were saying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Campion has thrown me over,” glared
Mr. Montgomerie.</p>

<p>“Then I have perhaps the very thing for
you,” Lady Katherine said, in a relieved way,
returning to her letters. “Sophia Merrenden
writes this morning, and among other things
tells me of her nephew, Lord Robert Vavasour&mdash;you
know, Torquilstone’s half-brother. She
says he is the most charming young man, and
a wonderful shot&mdash;she even suggests” (looking
back a page), “that he might be useful to
us, if we are short of a gun.”</p>

<p>“Damned kind of her,” growled Mr. Montgomerie.</p>

<p>I hope they did not notice, but I had suddenly
such a thrill of pleasure that I am sure
my cheeks got red. I felt frightfully excited
to hear what was going to happen.</p>

<p>“Merrenden, as you know, is the best judge
of shooting in England,” Lady Katherine went
on, in an injured voice. “Sophia is hardly
likely to recommend his nephew so highly if
he were not pretty good.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know the puppy, Katherine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>My heart fell.</p>

<p>“That is not the least consequence&mdash;we are
almost related. Merrenden is my first cousin,
you forget that, I suppose!”</p>

<p>Fortunately I could detect that Lady Katherine
was becoming obstinate and offended. I
drank some more coffee. Oh! how lovely if
Lord Robert comes!</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomerie “Bur-r-r-ed” a lot first,
but Lady Katherine got him round, and before
breakfast was over, it was decided she should
write to Lord Robert, and ask him to come to
the shoot. As we were all standing looking
out of the window at the dripping rain, I heard
her say in a low voice,</p>

<p>“Really, Anderson, we must think of the
girls sometimes. Torquilstone is a confirmed
bachelor and a cripple&mdash;Lord Robert will certainly
one day be Duke.”</p>

<p>“Well, catch him if you can,” said Mr.
Montgomerie. He is coarse sometimes!</p>

<p>I am not going to let myself think much
about Lord Robert&mdash;Mr. Carruthers has been
a lesson to me&mdash;but if he does come&mdash;I wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
if Lady Katherine will think it funny of me
not saying I knew him when she first spoke
of him. It is too late now, so it can’t be
helped.</p>

<p>The Mackintosh party arrived this afternoon.
Marriage must have quite different
effects on some people. Numbers of the
married women we saw in London were lovely,
prettier, I always heard, than they had been
before&mdash;but Mary Mackintosh is perfectly
awful. She can’t be more than twenty-seven,
but she looks forty, at least; and stout, and
sticking out all in the wrong places, and flat
where the stick-outs ought to be. And the four
children! The two eldest look much the same
age, the next a little smaller, and there is a
baby, and they all squall, and although they
seem to have heaps of nurses, poor Mr. Mackintosh
has to be a kind of under one. He
fetches and carries for them, and gives his
handkerchief when they slobber&mdash;but perhaps
it is he feels proud that a person of his size
had these four enormous babies almost all at
once like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole thing is simply dreadful.</p>

<p>Tea was a pandemonium! The four aunts
gushing over the infants, and feeding them
with cake, and gurgling with “Tootsie-wootsie-popsy-wopsy”
kind of noises. They will get
to do “Bur-r-r-rs” I am sure, when they grow
older. I wonder if the infants will come down
every afternoon when the shoot happens. The
guests will enjoy it!</p>

<p>I said to Jean as we came upstairs that I
thought it seemed terrible to get married&mdash;did
not she? But she was shocked, and said
no, marriage and motherhood were sacred
duties, and she envied her sister!</p>

<p>This kind of thing is not my idea of bliss.
Two really well-behaved children would be
delicious, I think; but four squalling imps all
about the same age is <i>bourgeois</i>, and not the
affair of a lady.</p>

<p>I suppose Lord Robert’s answer cannot get
here till about Saturday. I wonder how he arranged
it! It is clever of him. Lady Katherine
said this Mr. Campion who was coming is in
the same regiment, the 3rd Life Guards. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
when&mdash;but there is no use my thinking
about it&mdash;only somehow I am feeling so much
better to-night&mdash;gay, and as if I did not mind
being very poor&mdash;that I was obliged to tease
Malcolm a little after dinner. I <i>would</i> play Patience,
and never lifted my eyes from the cards!</p>

<p>He kept trying to say things to me to get
me to go to the piano, but I pretended I did
not notice. A palm stands at the corner of a
high Chippendale writing bureau, and Jessie
happened to have put the Patience table behind
that rather, so the rest of them could not
see everything that was happening. Malcolm
at last sat very near beside me, and wanted to
help with the aces&mdash;but I can’t bear people
being close to me, so I upset the board, and
he had to pick up all the cards on the floor.
Kirstie, for a wonder, played the piano then&mdash;a
cake walk&mdash;and there was something in it
that made me feel I wanted to move&mdash;to
dance&mdash;to undulate&mdash;I don’t know what, and
my shoulders swayed a little in time to the
music. Malcolm breathed quite as if he had
a cold, and said right in my ear, in a fat voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know you are a devil&mdash;and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I stopped him at once&mdash;looked up for
the first time, absolutely shocked and surprised.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Montgomerie, I do not know
what you mean,” I said.</p>

<p>He began to fidget.</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;I mean&mdash;I mean&mdash;I awfully wish to
kiss you.”</p>

<p>“But I do not a bit wish to kiss you!” I
said, and I opened my eyes wide at him.</p>

<p>He looked like a spiteful bantam, and fortunately
at that moment Jessie returned to the
Patience, and he could not say any more.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine and Mrs. Mackintosh came
into my room on the way up to bed. She&mdash;Lady
Katherine&mdash;wanted to show Mary how
beautifully they had had it done up, it used to
be hers before she married. They looked all
round at the dead-daffodil-coloured cretonne
and things, and at last I could see their eyes
often straying to my night-gown and dressing-gown,
laid out on a chair beside the fire.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady Katherine, I am afraid you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wondering at my having pink silk,” I said,
apologetically, “as I am in mourning, but I
have not had time to get a white dressing-gown
yet.”</p>

<p>“It is not that, dear,” said Lady Katherine,
in a grave duty voice. “I&mdash;I&mdash;do not think
such a night-gown is suitable for a girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but I am very strong,” I said. “I
never catch cold.”</p>

<p>Mary Mackintosh held it up, with a face
of stern disapproval. Of course it has short
sleeves ruffled with Valenciennes, and is fine
linen cambric nicely embroidered. Mrs. Carruthers
was always very particular about them,
and chose them herself at Doucet’s. She said
one never could know when places might catch
on fire.</p>

<p>“Evangeline, dear, you are very young, so
you probably cannot understand,” Mary said,
“but I consider this garment not in any way
fit for a girl&mdash;or for any good woman for that
matter. Mother, I hope my sisters have not
seen it!!”</p>

<p>I looked so puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>She examined the stuff, one could see the
chair through it, beyond.</p>

<p>“What <i>would</i> Alexander say if I were to
wear such a thing!”</p>

<p>This thought seemed almost to suffocate
them both, they looked genuinely pained and
shocked.</p>

<p>“Of course it would be too tight for you,”
I said, humbly, “but it is otherwise a very
good pattern, and does not tear when one puts
up one’s arms. Mrs. Carruthers made a fuss
at Doucet’s because my last set tore so soon,
and they altered these.”</p>

<p>At the mention of my late adopted mother,
both of them pulled themselves up.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carruthers we know had very odd
notions,” Lady Katherine said stiffly, “but I
hope, Evangeline, you have sufficient sense to
understand now for yourself that such a&mdash;a&mdash;garment
is not at all seemly.”</p>

<p>“Oh! why not, dear Lady Katherine?”
I said. “You don’t know how becoming
it is.”</p>

<p>“Becoming!” almost screamed Mary Mackintosh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“But no nice-minded woman wants
things to look becoming in bed!”</p>

<p>The whole matter appeared so painful to
them I covered up the offending ‘nighty’
with my dressing-gown, and coughed. It made
a break, and they went away, saying good-night
frigidly.</p>

<p>And now I am alone. But I do wonder why
it is wrong to look pretty in bed,&mdash;considering
nobody sees one, too!</p>

<p class="pr6 p2"><span class="smcap">Tryland Court</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Monday, November 14th</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> not felt like writing; these last days
have been so stodgy,&mdash;sticky I was going to
say! Endless infant talk! The methods of head
nurses, teething, the knavish tricks of nursemaids,
patent foods, bottles, bibs&mdash;everything!
Enough to put one off for ever from wishing
to get married! And Mary Mackintosh sitting
there all out of shape, expounding theories
that can have no results in practice, as there
could not be worse behaved children than hers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>They even try Lady Katherine, I can see,
when the two eldest, who come in while we
are at breakfast each day, take the jam spoon,
or something equally horrid, and dab it all
over the cloth. Yesterday they put their hands
in the honey dish which Mr. Montgomerie
was helping himself to, and then after smearing
him (the “Bur-r-r-s” were awful) they went
round the table to escape being caught, and
fingered the back of every one’s chair, and the
door handle, so that one could not touch a
thing without getting sticky.</p>

<p>“Alexander, dearie,” Mary said, “Alec
must have his mouth wiped.”</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Mackintosh had to get up and
leave his breakfast, catch these imps, and employ
his table-napkin in vain.</p>

<p>“Take ’em upstairs, do, Bur-r-r-r,” roared
their fond grandfather.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, the poor darlings are not really
naughty!” Mary said, offended. “I like them
to be with us all as much as possible. I thought
they would be such a pleasure to you.”</p>

<p>Upon which, hearing the altercation, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
infants set up a yell of fear and rage, and
Alec, the cherub of four and a half, lay on the
floor and kicked and screamed until he was
black in the face.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackintosh is too small to manage
two, so one of the footmen had to come and
help him to carry them up to their nursery!
Oh, I would not be in his place for the world!</p>

<p>Malcolm is becoming so funny! I suppose
he is attracted by me. He makes kind of love
in a priggish way whenever he gets the chance,
which is not often, as Lady Katherine contrives
to send one of the girls with us on all our
walks, or if we are in the drawing-room she
comes and sits down beside us herself. I am
glad, as it would be a great bore to listen to a
quantity of it.</p>

<p>How silly of her, though! She can’t know
as much about men as even I do&mdash;of course it
only makes him all the more eager.</p>

<p>It is quite an object lesson for me. I shall
be impossibly difficult myself if I meet Mr.
Carruthers again, as he has no mother to play
these tricks for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Robert’s answer came on Saturday
afternoon. It was all done through Lady Merrenden.</p>

<p>He will be delighted to come and shoot on
Tuesday&mdash;to-morrow. Oh! I am so glad&mdash;but
I do wonder if I shall be able to make
him understand not to say anything about
having been at Branches while I was there.
Such a simple thing, but Lady Katherine is so
odd and particular.</p>

<p>The party is to be a large one, nine guns&mdash;I
hope some will be amusing, though I rather
fear!</p>

<p class="pr2 p2"><i>Tuesday night</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is quite late, nearly twelve o’clock, but I
feel so wide awake I must write.</p>

<p>I shall begin from the beginning, when
every one arrived.</p>

<p>They came by two trains early in the afternoon,
and just at tea time, and Lord Robert
was among the last lot.</p>

<p>They are mostly the same sort as Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Katherine, looking as good as gold; but one
woman, Lady Verningham, Lady Katherine’s
niece, is different, and I liked her at once.</p>

<p>She has lovely clothes, and an exquisite
figure, and her hat on the right way. She has
charming manners too, but one can see she is
on a duty visit.</p>

<p>Even all this company did not altogether
stop Mary Mackintosh laying down the law
upon domestic&mdash;infant domestic&mdash;affairs. We
all sat in the big drawing-room, and I caught
Lady Verningham’s eye, and we laughed together!
The first eye with a meaning in it I
have seen since I left Branches.</p>

<p>Everybody talked so agreeably, with pauses,
not enjoying themselves at all, when Jean and
Kirstie began about their work, and explained
it, and tried to get orders, and Jessie and
Maggie too, and specimens of it all had to be
shown, and prices fixed. I should hate to have
to beg, even for a charity.</p>

<p>I felt quite uncomfortable for them, but
they did not mind a bit, and their victims
were noble over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Our parson at Branches always got so red
and nervous when he had to ask for anything;
one could see he was quite a gentleman&mdash;but
women are different, I suppose.</p>

<p>I longed for tea!</p>

<p>While they are all very kind here, there is
that asphyxiating atmosphere of stiffness and
decorum which affects every one who comes to
Tryland. A sort of “The gold must be tried
by fire, and the heart must be wrung by pain”
kind of suggestion about everything.</p>

<p>They are extraordinarily cheerful, because
it is a Christian virtue, cheerfulness; not
because they are brimming over with joy, or
that lovely feeling of being alive, and not
minding much what happens, you feel so
splendid, like I get on fine days.</p>

<p>Everything they do has a reason or a moral
in it. This party is because pheasants have to
be killed in November&mdash;and certain people
have to be entertained, and their charities can
be assisted through them. Oh! if I had a big
house, and were rich, I would have lovely
parties, with all sorts of nice people, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
I wanted to give them a good time and laugh
myself. Lady Verningham was talking to me
just before tea, when the second train load
arrived.</p>

<p>I tried to be quite indifferent, but I did
feel dreadfully excited when Lord Robert
walked in. Oh! he looked such a beautiful
creature, so smart, and straight, and lithe!</p>

<p>Lady Katherine was frightfully stiff with
him; it would have discouraged most people,
but that is the lovely part about Lord Robert,
he is always absolutely <i>sans gêne</i>!</p>

<p>He saw me at once, of course, and came
over as straight as a die the moment he
could.</p>

<p>“How do, Robert!” said Lady Verningham,
looking very surprised to see him, and
giving him her fingers in such an attractive
way. <i>How</i> are you here? And why is our
Campie not? Thereby hangs some tale, I
feel sure!”</p>

<p>“Why, yes!” said Lord Robert, and he held
her hand. Then he looked at me with his
eyebrows up. “But won’t you introduce me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Miss Travers? to my great chagrin she seems
to have forgotten me!”</p>

<p>I laughed, and Lady Verningham introduced
us, and he sat down beside us, and every one
began tea.</p>

<p>Lady Verningham had such a look in her eye!</p>

<p>“Robert, tell me about it!” she said.</p>

<p>“I hear they have five thousand pheasants
to slay,” Lord Robert replied, looking at her
with his innocent smile.</p>

<p>“Robert, you are lying!” she said, and she
laughed. She is so pretty when she laughs,
not very young, over thirty I should think,
but such a charm! As different as different can
be from the whole Montgomerie family!</p>

<p>I hardly spoke, they continued to tease one
another, and Lord Robert ate most of a plate
of bread and butter that was near.</p>

<p>“I am dam’d hungry, Lady Ver!” he said.
She smiled at him; she evidently likes him
very much.</p>

<p>“Robert! you must not use such language
here!” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, doesn’t he say them often! those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
dams!” I burst out, not thinking for a moment&mdash;then
I stopped, remembering. She did
seem surprised.</p>

<p>“So you have heard them before! I thought
you had only just met casually!” she said,
with such a comic look of understanding, but
not absolutely pleased. I stupidly got crimson,
it did annoy me, because it shows so dreadfully
on my skin. She leant back in her chair, and
laughed.</p>

<p>“It is delightful to shoot five thousand
pheasants, Robert,” she said.</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t it?” replied Lord Robert. He
had finished the bread and butter.</p>

<p>Then he told her she was a dear, and he was
glad something had suggested to Mr. Campion
that he would have other views of living for
this week.</p>

<p>“You are a joy, Robert!” she said, “but
you will have to behave here. None of the
tricks you played at Fotherington in October,
my child. Aunt Katherine would put you
in a corner. Miss Travers has been here a
week, and can tell you I am truthful about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, <i>yes!</i>” I said.</p>

<p>“But I <i>must</i> know how you got here,” she
commanded.</p>

<p>Just then, fortunately, Malcolm, who had
been hovering near, came up and joined us,
and would talk too; but if he had been a table,
or a chair, he could not have mattered less to
Lord Robert! He is quite wonderful! He is
not the least rude, only perfectly simple and
direct, always getting just what he wants, with
rather an appealing expression in his blue eyes.
In a minute or two he and I were talking
together, and Malcolm and Lady Verningham
a few yards off. I felt so happy. He makes
one like that, I don’t know for what reason.</p>

<p>“Why did you look so stonily indifferent
when I came up,” he asked. “I was afraid
you were annoyed with me for coming.”</p>

<p>Then I told him about Lady Katherine, and
my stupidly not having mentioned meeting
him at Branches.</p>

<p>“Oh! then I stayed with Christopher after
you left&mdash;I see,” he said. “Had I met you in
London?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t tell any stories about it. They
can think what they please.”</p>

<p>“Very well!” he laughed. “I can see I
shall have to manœuvre a good deal to talk
quietly to you here, but you will stand with
me, won’t you, out shooting to-morrow!”</p>

<p>I told him I did not suppose we should be
allowed to go out, except perhaps for lunch&mdash;but
he said he refused to believe in such
cruelty.</p>

<p>Then he asked me a lot of things about how
I had been getting on, and what I intended to
do next. He has the most charming way of
making one feel that one knows him very well,
he looks at one every now and then straight
in the eyes, with astonishing frankness. I have
never seen any person so quite without airs, I
don’t suppose he is ever thinking a bit the
effect he is producing. Nothing has two meanings
with him like with Mr. Carruthers. If
he had said I was to stay and marry him, I am
sure he would have meant it, and I really
believe I should have stayed!</p>

<p>“Do you remember our morning packing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>”
he said, presently, in such a caressing voice.
“I was so happy, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>I said I was.</p>

<p>“And Christopher was mad with us! He
was like a bear with a sore head after you left,
and insisted upon going up to town on
Monday just for the day; he came over here
on Tuesday, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“No, he did not,” I was obliged to say,
and I felt cross about it still, I don’t know
why.</p>

<p>“He is a queer creature,” said Lord Robert,
“and I am glad you have not seen him&mdash;I
don’t want him in the way. I am a selfish
brute, you know.”</p>

<p>I said Mrs. Carruthers had always brought
me up to know men were that, so such a thing
would not prejudice me against him.</p>

<p>He laughed. “You must help me to come
and sit and talk again, after dinner,” he said.
“I can see the red-haired son means you for
himself, but, of course, I shall not allow that!”</p>

<p>I became uppish.</p>

<p>“Malcolm and I are great friends,” I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
demurely. “He walks me round the golf
course in the park, and gives me advice.”</p>

<p>“Confounded impertinence!” said Lord
Robert.</p>

<p>“He thinks I ought not to go to Claridge’s
alone when I leave here, in case some one made
love to me. He feels if I looked more like his
sisters it would be safer. I have promised that
Véronique shall stay at the other side of the
door if I have visitors.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is afraid of that, is he! Well, I
think it is very probable his fears will be realized,
as I shall be in London,” said Lord Robert.</p>

<p>“But how do you know,” I began, with a
questioning, serious air; “how do you know
I should listen? You can’t go on to deaf people,
can you?”</p>

<p>“Are you deaf?” he asked. “I don’t think
so, anyway I would try to cure your deafness.”
He bent close over to me, pretending to pick
up a book.</p>

<p>Oh, I was having such a nice time!</p>

<p>All of a sudden I felt I was really living,
the blood was jumping in my veins, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
number of provoking, agreeable things came
to the tip of my tongue to say, and I said them.
We were so happy!</p>

<p>Lord Robert is such a beautiful shape, that
pleased me too; the perfect lines of things
always give me a nice emotion. The other men
look thick and clumsy beside him, and he does
have such lovely clothes and ties!</p>

<p>We talked on and on. He began to show
me he was deeply interested in me. His eyes,
so blue and expressive, said even more than his
words. I like to see him looking down; his
eyelashes are absurdly long and curly, not jet
black like mine and Mr. Carruthers’, but dark
brown and soft, and shaded, and oh! I don’t
know how to say quite why they are so attractive.
When one sees them half resting on his cheek
it makes one feel it would be nice to put out
the tip of one’s finger, and touch them. I never
spent such a delightful afternoon. Only alas!
it was all too short.</p>

<p>“We will arrange to sit together after
dinner,” he whispered, as even before the
dressing gong had rung Lady Katherine came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and fussed about, and collected every one, and
more or less drove them off to dress, saying,
on the way upstairs, to me, that I need not
come down if I had rather not!</p>

<p>I thanked her again, but remained firm in my
intention of accustoming myself to company.</p>

<p>Stay in my room, indeed, with Lord Robert
at dinner&mdash;never!</p>

<p>However, when I did come down, he was
surrounded by Montgomeries, and pranced
into the dining-room with Lady Verningham.
She must have arranged that.</p>

<p>I had such a bore! A young Mackintosh
cousin of Mary’s husband, and on the other
side the parson. The one talked about botany
in a hoarse whisper, with a Scotch accent, and
the other gobbled his food, and made kind of
pious jokes in between the mouthfuls!</p>

<p>I said&mdash;when I had borne it bravely up to
the ices&mdash;I hated knowing what flowers were
composed of, I only liked to pick them. The
youth stared, and did not speak much more.
For the parson, “yes” now and then did, and
like that we got through dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Malcolm was opposite me, and he gaped
most of the time. Even he might have been
better than the botanist, but I suppose Lady
Katherine felt these two would be a kind of
half mourning for me. No one could have felt
gay with them.</p>

<p>After dinner Lady Verningham took me over
to a sofa with her, in a corner. The sofas here
don’t have pillows, as at Branches, but fortunately
this one is a little apart, though not
comfortable, and we could talk.</p>

<p>“You poor child,” she said, “you had a
dull time. I was watching you! What did that
M<sup>c</sup>Tavish creature find to say to you?”</p>

<p>I told her, and that his name was Mackintosh,
not M<sup>c</sup>Tavish.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she said, “but I call the
whole clan M<sup>c</sup>Tavish&mdash;it is near enough,
and it does worry Mary so; she corrects me
every time. Now don’t you want to get married,
and be just like Mary?” There was a twinkle
in her eye.</p>

<p>I said I had not felt wild about it yet. I
wanted to go and see life first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>But she told me one couldn’t see life unless
one was married.</p>

<p>“Not even if one is an adventuress, like
me?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A <i>what!!</i>”</p>

<p>“An adventuress,” I said. “People do seem
so astonished when I say that! I have got to
be one, you know, because Mrs. Carruthers
never left me the money after all, and in the
book I read about it, it said you were that if
you had nice clothes, and&mdash;and&mdash;red hair&mdash;and
things and no home.”</p>

<p>She rippled all over with laughter.</p>

<p>“You duck!” she said. “Now you and I
will be friends. Only you must not play with
Robert Vavasour. He belongs to me! He is
one of my special and particular own pets. Is
it a bargain?”</p>

<p>I do wish now I had had the pluck then to
say straight out that I rather liked Lord Robert,
and would not make any bargain, but one is
foolish sometimes when taken suddenly. It is
then when I suppose it shows if one’s head is
screwed on firmly, and mine wasn’t to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
But she looked so charming, and I felt a little
proud, and perhaps ashamed to show that I am
very much interested in Lord Robert, especially
if he belongs to her, whatever that means, and
so I said it was a bargain, and of course I had
never thought of playing with him, but when
I came to reflect afterwards, that is a promise,
I suppose, and I sha’n’t be able to look at him
any more under my eyelashes. And I don’t
know why I feel very wide awake and tired,
and rather silly, and as if I wanted to cry to-night.</p>

<p>However, she was awfully kind to me, and
lovely, and has asked me to go and stay with
her, and lots of nice things, so it is all for the
best, no doubt. But when Lord Robert came
in, and came over to us, it did feel hard having
to get up at once and go and pretend I wanted
to talk to Malcolm.</p>

<p>I did not dare to look up often, but sometimes,
and I found Lord Robert’s eyes were
fixed on me with an air of reproach and
entreaty, and the last time there was wrath as
well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Verningham kept him with her until
every one started to go to bed.</p>

<p>There had been music and bridge, and other
boring diversions happening, but I sat still.
And I don’t know what Malcolm had been
talking about, I had not been listening, though
I kept murmuring “Yes” and “No.”</p>

<p>He got more and more <i>empressé</i>, until
suddenly I realized he was saying, as we
rose:</p>

<p>“You have promised! Now remember, and
I shall ask you to keep it&mdash;to-morrow!”</p>

<p>And there was such a loving, mawkish,
wobbly look in his eyes, it made me feel quite
sick. The horrible part is, I don’t know what
I have promised any more than the man in the
moon! It may be something perfectly dreadful,
for all I know! Well, if it is a fearful
thing, like kissing him, I shall have to break
my word,&mdash;which I never do for any consideration
whatever.</p>

<p>Oh, dear! oh, dear! it is not always so easy
to laugh at life as I once thought! I almost
wish I were settled down, and had not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
an adventuress. Some situations are so difficult.
I think now I shall go to bed.</p>

<p>I wonder if Lord Robert&mdash;no, what is the
good of wondering; he is no longer my affair.</p>

<p>I shall blow out the light!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<p class="pr4 p2">300, <span class="smcap">Park Street</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Saturday night, Nov. 19th</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not much care to look back to the rest
of my stay at Tryland. It is an unpleasant
memory.</p>

<p>That next day after I last wrote, it poured
with rain, and every one came down cross to
breakfast. The whole party appeared except
Lady Verningham, and breakfast was just as
stiff and boring as dinner. I happened to be
seated when Lord Robert came in, and Malcolm
was in the place beside me. Lord Robert hardly
spoke, and looked at me once, or twice, with
his eyebrows right up.</p>

<p>I did long to say it was because I had
promised Lady Ver I would not play with
him that I was not talking to him now like
the afternoon before. I wonder if he ever
guessed it. Oh! I wished then, and I have
wished a hundred times since, that I had never
promised at all. It seemed as if it would be
wisest to avoid him, as how could I explain
the change in myself. I hated the food, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Malcolm had such an air of proprietorship, it
annoyed me as much as I could see it annoyed
Lady Katherine. I sniffed at him, and was as
disagreeable as could be.</p>

<p>The breakfasts there don’t shine, and porridge
is pressed upon people by Mr. Montgomerie.
“Capital stuff to begin the day,
Bur-r-r-r,” he says.</p>

<p>Lord Robert could not find anything he
wanted, it seemed. Every one was peevish.
Lady Katherine has a way of marshalling people
on every occasion; she reminds me of a hen
with chickens, putting her wings down, and
clucking, and chasing, till they are all in a
corner. And she is rather that shape, too, very
much rounded in front. The female brood
soon found themselves in the morning-room,
with the door shut, and no doubt the male
things fared the same with their host, anyway
we saw no more of them till we caught sight
of them passing the windows in ’scutums and
mackintoshes, a depressed company of sportsmen.</p>

<p>The only fortunate part was that Malcolm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
had found no opportunity to remind me of
my promise, whatever it was, and I felt safer.</p>

<p>Oh! that terrible morning! Much worse
than when we were alone&mdash;nearly all of
them&mdash;about seven women beyond the family&mdash;began
fancy work.</p>

<p>One, a Lady Letitia Smith, was doing a
crewel silk blotting-book that made me quite
bilious to look at, and she was very short-sighted,
and had such an irritating habit of
asking every one to match her threads for her.
They knitted ties and stockings, and crocheted
waistcoats and comforters and hoods for the
North Sea fishermen, and one even tatted.
Just like housemaids do in their spare hours
to trim Heaven knows what garment of unbleached
calico.</p>

<p>I asked her what it was for, and she said
for the children’s pinafores in her “Guild”
work. If one doesn’t call that waste of time,
I wonder what is!</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers said it was much more
useful to learn to sit still and not fidget than
to fill the world with rubbish like this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Mackintosh dominated the conversation.
She and Lady Letitia Smith, who have
both small babies, revelled in nursery details,
and then whispered bits for us&mdash;the young
girls&mdash;not to hear. We caught scraps though,
and it sounded gruesome, whatever it was
about. Oh! I do wonder when I get married
if I shall grow like them.</p>

<p>I hope not.</p>

<p>It is no wonder married men are obliged to
say gallant things to other people, if, when
they get home, their wives are like that.</p>

<p>I tried to be agreeable to a lady who was
next me. She was a Christian Scientist, and
wore glasses. She endeavoured to convert me,
but I was abnormally thick-headed that day,
and had to have things explained over and
over, so she gave it up at last.</p>

<p>Finally when I felt I should do something
desperate, a footman came to say Lady Verningham
wished to see me in her room, and
I bounded up&mdash;but as I got to the door I
saw them beginning to shake their heads
over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sad that dear Ianthe has such irregular
habits of breakfasting in her room&mdash;so bad
for her,” etc., etc., but thank heaven, I was
soon outside in the hall, where her maid was
waiting for me.</p>

<p>One would hardly have recognized that it
was a Montgomerie apartment, the big room
overlooking the porch, where she was located.
So changed did its aspect seem! She had
numbers of photographs about, and the loveliest
gold toilet things, and lots of frilled garments,
and flowers, and scent bottles, and her
own pillows propping her up, all blue silk,
and lovely muslin embroideries, and she did
look such a sweet cosy thing among it all.
Her dark hair in fluffs round her face, and an
angelic lace cap over it. She was smoking a
cigarette, and writing numbers of letters with
a gold stylograph pen. The blue silk quilt
was strewn with correspondence, and newspapers,
and telegraph forms. And her garment
was low-necked, of course, and thin like
mine are. I wondered what Alexander would
have thought if he could have seen her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
contrast to Mary! I know which I would
choose if I were a man!</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are!” she exclaimed, looking
up and puffing smoke clouds. “Sit on
the bye-bye, Snake-girl. I felt I must rescue
you from the horde of Holies below, and I
wanted to look at you in the daylight. Yes,
you have extraordinary hair, and real eyelashes
and complexion, too. You are a witch
thing, I can see, and we shall all have to
beware of you!”</p>

<p>I smiled. She did not say it rudely, or I
should have been uppish at once. She has a
wonderful charm.</p>

<p>“You don’t speak much, either,” she continued.
“I feel you are dangerous! that is why
I am being so civil to you; I think it wisest.
I can’t stand girls as a rule!” And she went
into one of her ripples of laughter. “Now say
you will not hurt me!”</p>

<p>“I should not hurt anyone,” I said, “unless
they hurt me first&mdash;and I like you&mdash;you
are so pretty.”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” she said, “then we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
comrades. I was frightened about Robert last
evening, because I am so attached to him, but
you were a darling after dinner, and it will be
all right now; I told him you would probably
marry Malcolm Montgomerie, and he was not
to interfere.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the kind!” I exclaimed,
moving off the bed. “I would as soon
die as spend the rest of my life here at Tryland.”</p>

<p>“He will be fabulously rich one day, you
know, and you could get round Père Montgomerie
in a trice, and revolutionize the whole
place. You had better think of it.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” I said, and I felt my eyes sparkle.
She put up her hands as if to ward off an
evil spirit, and she laughed again.</p>

<p>“Well, you sha’n’t then! Only don’t flash
those emeralds at me, they give me quivers all
over!”</p>

<p>“Would <i>you</i> like to marry Malcolm?” I
asked, and I sat down again. “Fancy being
owned by that! Fancy seeing it every day!
Fancy living with a person who never sees a
joke from week’s end to week’s end. Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“As for that”&mdash;and she puffed smoke&mdash;“husbands
are a race apart&mdash;there are men,
women, and husbands, and if they pay bills,
and shoot big game in Africa, it is all one
ought to ask of them; to be able to see jokes
is superfluous. Mine is most inconvenient,
because he generally adores me, and at best
only leaves me for a three weeks’ cure at
Homburg, and now and then a week in Paris,
but Malcolm could be sent to the Rocky
Mountains, and places like that, continuously;
he is quite a sportsman.”</p>

<p>“That is not my idea of a husband,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, what is your idea, Snake-girl?”</p>

<p>“Why do you call me ‘Snake-girl?’” I
asked. “I hate snakes.”</p>

<p>She took her cigarette out of her mouth,
and looked at me for some seconds.</p>

<p>“Because you are so sinuous, there is not
a stiff line about your movements&mdash;you are
utterly wicked looking and attractive too, and
un-English, and what in the world Aunt
Katherine asked you here for, with those
hideous girls, I can’t imagine. I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
have if my three angels were grown up, and
like them.” Then she showed me the photographs
of her three angels&mdash;they are pets.</p>

<p>But my looks seemed to bother her, for she
went back to the subject.</p>

<p>“Where do you get them from? Was your
mother some other nation?”</p>

<p>I told her how poor mamma had been rather
an accident, and was nobody much. “One
could not tell, you see, she might have had
any quaint creature beyond the grandparents&mdash;perhaps
I am mixed with Red Indian, or
nigger.”</p>

<p>She looked at me searchingly.</p>

<p>“No, you are not, you are Venetian&mdash;that
is it&mdash;some wicked, beautiful friend of a
Doge come to life again.”</p>

<p>“I know I am wicked,” I said; “I am always
told it, but I have not done anything
yet, or had any fun out of it, and I do want to.”</p>

<p>She laughed again.</p>

<p>“Well, you must come to London with me
when I leave here on Saturday, and we will see
what we can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>This sounded so nice, and yet I had a feeling
that I wanted to refuse; if there had been
a tone of patronage in her voice, I would have
in a minute. We sat and talked a long time,
and she did tell me some interesting things.
The world, she assured me, was a delightful
place if one could escape bores, and had a good
cook and a few friends. After a while I left
her, as she suddenly thought she would come
down to luncheon.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be safe, at the
present stage, to leave you alone with Robert,”
she said.</p>

<p>I was angry.</p>

<p>“I have promised not to play with him, is
that not enough!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I believe it is, Snake-girl!”
she said, and there was something wistful in
her eyes, “but you are twenty, and I am past
thirty, and&mdash;he is a man!&mdash;so one can’t be too
careful!” Then she laughed, and I left her
putting a toe into a blue satin slipper, and
ringing for her maid.</p>

<p>I don’t think age can matter much, she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
far far more attractive than any girl, and she
need not pretend she is afraid of me. But the
thing that struck me then, and has always
struck me since is that to have to <i>hold</i> a man
by one’s own manœuvres could not be agreeable
to one’s self-respect. I would <i>never</i> do
that under any circumstances; if he would not
stay because it was the thing he wanted to do
most in the world, he might go. I should say,
“<i>Je m’en fiche!</i>”</p>

<p>At luncheon, for which the guns came in,&mdash;no
nice picnic in a lodge as at Branches&mdash;I
purposely sat between two old gentlemen, and
did my best to be respectful and intelligent.
One was quite a nice old thing, and at the end
began paying me compliments. He laughed,
and laughed at everything I said. Opposite
me were Malcolm and Lord Robert, with
Lady Ver between them. They both looked
sulky. It was quite a while before she could
get them gay and pleasant. I did not enjoy
myself.</p>

<p>After it was over, Lord Robert deliberately
walked up to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why are you so capricious?” he asked.
“I won’t be treated like this, you know very
well I have only come here to see you. We
are such friends&mdash;or were. Why?”</p>

<p>Oh! I did want to say I was friends still,
and would love to talk to him. He seemed so
adorably good looking, and such a shape! and his
blue eyes had the nicest flash of anger in them.</p>

<p>I could have kept my promise to the letter,
and yet broken it in the spirit, easily enough,
by letting him understand by inference&mdash;but
of course one could not be so mean as that,
when one was going to eat her salt, so I looked
out of the window, and answered coldly that
I was quite friendly, and did not understand
him, and I immediately turned to my old
gentleman, and walked with him into the
library. In fact I was as cool as I could be
without being actually rude, but all the time
there was a flat, heavy feeling round my heart.
He looked so cross and reproachful, and I did
not like him to think me capricious.</p>

<p>We did not see them again until tea; the
sportsmen, I mean. But tea at Tryland is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a friendly time. It is just as stiff as other
meals. Lady Ver never let Lord Robert
leave her side, and immediately after tea
everybody who stayed in the drawing-room
played bridge, where they were planted until
the dressing-bell rang.</p>

<p>One would have thought Lady Katherine
would have disapproved of cards, but I suppose
every one must have one contradiction
about them, for she loves bridge, and played
for the lowest stakes with the air of a “needy
adventurer” as the books say.</p>

<p>I can’t write the whole details of the rest of
the visit. I was miserable, and that is the truth.
Fate seemed to be against Lord Robert speaking
to me&mdash;even when he tried&mdash;and I felt I
must be extra cool and nasty because I&mdash;Oh!
well, I may as well say it&mdash;he attracts me very
much. I never once looked at him from under
my eyelashes, and after the next day, he did
not even try to have an explanation.</p>

<p>He glanced with wrath sometimes&mdash;especially
when Malcolm hung over me&mdash;and Lady
Ver said his temper was dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>She was so sweet to me, it almost seemed
as if she wanted to make up to me for not letting
me play with Lord Robert.</p>

<p>(Of course I would not allow her to see I
minded that.)</p>

<p>And finally Friday came, and the last night.</p>

<p>I sat in my room from tea until dinner. I
could not stand Malcolm any longer. I had
fenced with him rather well up to that, but
that promise of mine hung over me. I nipped
him every time he attempted to explain what
it was, and to this moment l don’t know, but
it did not prevent him from saying tiresome,
loving things, mixed with priggish advice. I
don’t know what would have happened only
when he got really horribly affectionate just
after tea I was so exasperated, I launched this
bomb.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word you are saying&mdash;your
real interest is Angela Grey.”</p>

<p>He nearly had a fit, and shut up at once.
So, of course, it is not a horse. I felt sure of
it. Probably one of those people Mrs. Carruthers
said all young men knew; their adolescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
measles and chicken-pox she called
them.</p>

<p>All the old men talked a great deal to me;
and even the other two young ones, but these
last days I did not seem to have any of my
usual spirits. Just as we were going to bed
on Friday night Lord Robert came up to
Lady Ver&mdash;she had her hand through my
arm.</p>

<p>“I can come to the play with you to-morrow
night, after all,” he said. “I have wired to
Campion to make a fourth, and you will get
some other woman, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I will try,” said Lady Ver, and she
looked right into his eyes, then she turned to
me. “I shall feel so cruel leaving you alone,
Evangeline” (at once almost she called me
Evangeline, I should never do that with
strangers), “but I suppose you ought not to be
seen at a play just yet.”</p>

<p>“I like being alone,” I said. “I shall go to
sleep early.”</p>

<p>Then they settled to dine all together at her
house, and go on; so, knowing I should see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
him again, I did not even say good-bye to
Lord Robert, and he left by the early train.</p>

<p>A number of the guests came up to London
with us.</p>

<p>My leavetaking with Lady Katherine had
been coldly cordial. I thanked her deeply for
her kindness in asking me there. She did not
renew the invitation; I expect she felt a person
like I am, who would have to look after
herself, was not a suitable companion to her
altar-cloth and poker workers.</p>

<p>Up to now&mdash;she told Lady Ver&mdash;of course
I had been most carefully brought up and
taken care of by Mrs. Carruthers, although
she had not approved of her views. And
having done her best for me at this juncture,
saving me from staying alone with Mr.
Carruthers, she felt it was all she was called
upon to do. She thought my position would
become too unconventional for their circle in
future! Lady Ver told me all this with great
glee. She was sure it would amuse me, it
so amused her&mdash;but it made me a teeny bit
remember the story of the boys and the frogs!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ver now and then puts out a claw
which scratches, while she ripples with laughter.
Perhaps she does not mean it.</p>

<p>This house is nice, and full of pretty things
as far as I have seen. We arrived just in time
to fly into our clothes for dinner. I am in a
wee room four stories up, by the three angels.
I was down first, and Lord Robert and Mr.
Campion were in the drawing-room. Sir
Charles Verningham is in Paris, by the way,
so I have not seen him yet.</p>

<p>Lord Robert was stroking the hair of the
eldest angel, who had not gone to bed. The
loveliest thing she is, and so polite, and different
from Mary Mackintosh’s infants.</p>

<p>He introduced Mr. Campion stiffly, and
returned to Mildred&mdash;the angel.</p>

<p>Suddenly mischief came into me, the reaction
from the last dull days, so I looked
straight at Mr. Campion from under my eyelashes,
and it had the effect it always has on
people, he became interested at once. I don’t
know why this does something funny to them.
I remember I first noticed it in the schoolroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
at Branches. I was doing a horrible exercise
upon the <i>Participe Passé</i>, and feeling very
<i>égarée</i>, when one of the old Ambassadors came
in to see Mademoiselle. I looked up quickly,
with my head a little down, and he said to
Mademoiselle, in a low voice, in German, that
I had the strangest eyes he had ever seen, and
that up look under the eyelashes was the affair
of the devil!</p>

<p>Now I knew even then the affair of the devil
is something attractive, so I have never forgotten
it, although I was only about fifteen at
the time. I always determined I would try it
when I grew up, and wanted to create emotions.
Except Mr. Carruthers and Lord Robert I have
never had much chance though.</p>

<p>Mr. Campion sat down beside me on a sofa,
and began to say at once that I ought to be
going to the play with them; I spoke in my
velvet voice, and said I was in too deep mourning,
and he apologized so nicely, rather confused.</p>

<p>He is quite a decent-looking person, smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and well-groomed, like Lord Robert, but not
that lovely shape. We talked on for about ten
minutes. I said very little, but he never took
his eyes off my face. All the time I was conscious
that Lord Robert was fidgeting and
playing with a china cow that was on a table
near, and just before the butler announced
Mrs. Fairfax, he dropped it on the floor, and
broke its tail off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfax is not pretty; she has reddish
gold hair, with brown roots, and a very dark
skin, but it is nicely done&mdash;the hair, I mean,
and perhaps the skin too, as sideways you can
see the pink sticking up on it. It must be
rather a nuisance to have to do all that, but it
is certainly better than looking like Mary
Mackintosh. She doesn’t balance nicely, bits
of her are too long, or too short. I do like to
see everything in the right place&mdash;like Lord
Robert’s figure. Lady Ver came in just then,
and we all went down to dinner. Mrs. Fairfax
gushed at her a good deal. Lady Ver does
not like her much, she told me in the train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
but she was obliged to wire to her to come, as
she could not get any one else Mr. Campion
liked, on so short a notice.</p>

<p>“The kind of woman every one knows, and
who has no sort of pride,” she said.</p>

<p>Well, even when I am really an adventuress
I sha’n’t be like that.</p>

<p>Dinner was very gay.</p>

<p>Lady Ver, away from her decorous relations,
is most amusing. She says anything
that comes into her head. Mrs. Fairfax got
cross because Mr. Campion would speak to
me, but as I did not particularly take to her,
I did not mind, and just amused myself. As
the party was so small Lord Robert and I were
obliged to talk a little, and once or twice I
forgot, and let myself be natural and smile at
him. His eyebrows went up in that questioning
pathetic way he has, and he looked so
attractive&mdash;that made me remember again, and
instantly turn away. When we were coming
into the hall, while Lady Ver and Mrs. Fairfax
were up putting on their cloaks, Lord
Robert came up close to me, and whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“I <i>can’t</i> understand you. There is some
reason for your treating me like this, and I
will find it out! Why are you so cruel, little
wicked tiger cat!” and he pinched one of my
fingers until I could have cried out.</p>

<p>That made me so angry.</p>

<p>“How dare you touch me!” I said. “It is
because you know I have no one to take care
of me that you presume like this!”</p>

<p>I felt my eyes blaze at him, but there was a
lump in my throat, I would not have been
hurt, if it had been anyone else&mdash;only angry&mdash;but
he had been so respectful and gentle
with me at Branches&mdash;and I had liked him so
much. It seemed more cruel for him to be
impertinent now.</p>

<p>His face fell, indeed, all the fierceness went
out of it, and he looked intensely miserable.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t say that!” he said, in a choked
voice. “I&mdash;oh! that is the one thing, you
know is not true.”</p>

<p>Mr. Campion, with his fur coat fastened,
came up at that moment, saying gallant things,
and insinuations that we must meet again, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I said good-night quietly, and came up the
stairs without a word more to Lord Robert.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Evangeline, pet,” Lady Ver
said, when I met her on the drawing-room
landing, coming down. “I do feel a wretch
leaving you, but to-morrow I will really try and
amuse you. You look very pale, child&mdash;the
journey has tried you probably.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am tired,” I tried to say in a natural
voice, but the end word shook a little, and
Lord Robert was just behind, having run up
the stairs after me, so I fear he must have
heard.</p>

<p>“Miss Travers&mdash;please&mdash;” he implored, but
I walked on up the next flight, and Lady Ver
put her hand on his arm, and drew him down
with her, and as I got up to the fourth floor
I heard the front door shut.</p>

<p>And now they are gone, and I am alone.
My tiny room is comfortable, and the fire is
burning brightly. I have a big armchair and
books, and this, my journal, and all is cosy&mdash;only
I feel so miserable.</p>

<p>I won’t cry and be a silly coward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Why, of course it is amusing to be free.
And I am <i>not</i> grieving over Mrs. Carruthers’
death&mdash;only perhaps I am lonely, and I wish
I were at the theatre. No, I don’t&mdash;I&mdash;oh,
the thing I do wish is that&mdash;that&mdash;<i>No</i>, I won’t
write it even.</p>

<p>Good-night, Journal!</p>

<p class="pr4 p2"><span class="smcap">300, Park Street</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Wednesday November 23rd.</i></p>


<p>OH! how silly to want the moon! but that
is evidently what is the matter with me. Here
I am in a comfortable house with a kind hostess,
and no immediate want of money, and yet I am
restless, and sometimes unhappy.</p>

<p>For the four days since I arrived Lady
Ver has been so kind to me, taken the greatest
pains to try and amuse me, and cheer me up.
We have driven about in her electric brougham
and shopped, and agreeable people have been
to lunch each day, and I have had what I
suppose is a <i>succès</i>. At least she says so.</p>

<p>I am beginning to understand things better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and it seems one must have no real feelings,
just as Mrs. Carruthers always told me, if one
wants to enjoy life.</p>

<p>On two evenings Lady Ver has been
out with numbers of regrets at leaving me
behind, and I have gathered she has seen Lord
Robert, but he has not been here&mdash;I am glad to
say.</p>

<p>I am real friends with the angels, who are
delightful people, and very well brought up.
Lady Ver evidently knows much better about
it than Mary Mackintosh, although she does
not talk in that way.</p>

<p>I can’t think what I am going to do next. I
suppose soon this kind of drifting will seem
quite natural, but at present the position galls
me for some reason. I <i>hate</i> to think people are
being kind out of charity. How very foolish
of me, though!</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden is coming to lunch to-morrow.
I am interested to see her, because
Lord Robert said she was such a dear. I wonder
what has become of him, that he has not been
here&mdash;I wonder. No, I am <i>too</i> silly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ver does not get up to breakfast, and
I go into her room, and have mine on another
little tray, and we talk, and she reads me bits
out of her letters.</p>

<p>She seems to have a number of people in
love with her&mdash;that must be nice.</p>

<p>“It keeps Charlie always devoted,” she said,
“because he realizes he owns what the other
men want.”</p>

<p>She says, too, that all male creatures are
fighters by nature, they don’t value things they
obtain easily, and which are no trouble to keep.
You must always make them realize you will
be off like a snipe if they relax their efforts to
please you for one moment.</p>

<p>Of course there are heaps of humdrum ways
of living, where the husband is quite fond, but
it does not make his heart beat, and Lady
Ver says she couldn’t stay on with a man
whose heart she couldn’t make beat when she
wanted to.</p>

<p>I am curious to see Sir Charles.</p>

<p>They play bridge a good deal in the afternoon,
and it amuses me a little to talk nicely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to the man who is out for the moment, and
make him not want to go back to the game.</p>

<p>I am learning a number of things.</p>

<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Night.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carruthers</span> came to call this afternoon.
He was the last person I expected to see when
I went into the drawing-room after luncheon,
to wait for Lady Ver. I had my outdoor
things on, and a big black hat, which is rather
becoming, I am glad to say.</p>

<p>“You here!” he exclaimed, as we shook
hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, why not?” I said.</p>

<p>He looked very self-contained, and reserved,
I thought, as if he had not the least intention
of letting himself go to display any interest. It
instantly aroused in me an intention to change
all that.</p>

<p>“Lady Verningham kindly asked me to
spend a few days with her when we left Tryland,”
I said, demurely.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are staying here! Well, I was
over at Tryland the day before yesterday&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
elaborate invitation from Lady Katherine
to ‘dine and sleep quietly,’ which I only
accepted as I thought I should see you.”</p>

<p>“How good of you,” I said, sweetly. “And
did they not tell you I had gone with Lady
Verningham?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind. They merely announced
that you had departed for London, so
I supposed it was your original design of
Claridge’s, and I intended going round there
some time to find you.”</p>

<p>Again I said it was so good of him, and I
looked down.</p>

<p>He did not speak for a second or two, and
I remained perfectly still.</p>

<p>“What are your plans?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“I have no plans&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you must have&mdash;that is ridiculous&mdash;you
must have made some decision as to where
you are going to live!”</p>

<p>“No, I assure you,” I said, calmly, “when
I leave here on Saturday, I shall just get into a
cab, and think of some place for it to take me
to, I suppose, as we turn down Park Lane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>He moved uneasily, and I glanced at him
up from under my hat. I don’t know why he
does not attract me now as much as he did at
first. There is something so cold and cynical
about his face.</p>

<p>“Listen, Evangeline,” he said at last.
“Something must be settled for you&mdash;I cannot
allow you to drift about like this. I am more
or less your guardian&mdash;you know&mdash;you must
feel that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t a bit,” I said.</p>

<p>“You impossible little&mdash;witch!” he came
closer.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lady Verningham says I am a witch,
and a snake, and all sorts of bad attractive
things, and I want to go somewhere where I
shall be able to show these qualities! England
is dull&mdash;what do you think of Paris?”</p>

<p>Oh! it did amuse me, launching forth these
remarks. They would never come into my head
for any one else!</p>

<p>He walked across the room and back. His
face was disturbed.</p>

<p>“You shall not go to Paris&mdash;alone. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
can you even suggest such a thing,” he
said.</p>

<p>I did not speak. He grew exasperated.</p>

<p>“Your father’s people are all dead, you tell
me, and you know nothing of your mother’s
relations, but who was she? What was her
name? Perhaps we could discover some kith
and kin for you.”</p>

<p>“My mother was called Miss Tonkins,” I
said.</p>

<p>“<i>Called</i> Miss Tonkins?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then it was not her name&mdash;what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>I hated these questions.</p>

<p>“I suppose it was her name. I never heard
she had another.”</p>

<p>“Tonkins,” he said, “Tonkins?” and he
looked searchingly at me, with his monk of the
Inquisition air.</p>

<p>I can be so irritating not telling people
things when I like, and it was quite a while
before he elicited the facts from me, which
Mrs. Carruthers had often hurled at my head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in moments of anger, that poor mamma’s
father had been Lord de Brandreth, and her
mother Heaven knows who!</p>

<p>“So you see”&mdash;I ended with&mdash;“I haven’t
any relations, after all, have I?”</p>

<p>He sat down upon the sofa.</p>

<p>“Evangeline, there is nothing for it, you
must marry me,” he said.</p>

<p>I sat down opposite him.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are funny!” I said. “You, a
clever diplomat, to know so little of women.
Who in the world would accept such an offer!”
and I laughed, and laughed.</p>

<p>“What am I to do with you!” he exclaimed,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” I laughed still, and I looked
at him with my “affair of the devil” look.
He came over, and forcibly took my hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are a witch,” he said. “A witch
who casts spells, and destroys resolutions and
judgements. I determined to forget you, and
put you out of my life&mdash;you are most unsuitable
to me, you know, but as soon as I see you
I am filled with only one desire. I <i>must</i> have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for myself&mdash;I want to kiss you&mdash;to touch you.
I want to prevent any other man from looking
at you&mdash;do you hear me, Evangeline?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear,” I said. “But it does not
have any effect on me. You would be awful
as a husband. Oh! I know all about them!”
and I looked up. “I saw several sorts at
Tryland, and Lady Verningham has told me
of the rest; and I know you would be no
earthly good in that <i>rôle</i>!”</p>

<p>He laughed, in spite of himself, but he still
held my hand.</p>

<p>“Describe their types to me, that I may
see which I should be,” he said, with great
seriousness.</p>

<p>“There is the Mackintosh kind&mdash;humble
and ‘titsy-pootsy,’ and a sort of under nurse,”
I said.</p>

<p>“That is not my size, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Then there is the Montgomerie, selfish
and bullying, and near about money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I am not Scotch.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;well, Lord Kestervin was English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and he fussed and worried, and looked out
trains all the time.”</p>

<p>“I shall have a groom of the chambers.”</p>

<p>“And they were all casual and indifferent
to their poor wives! and boresome, and
bored!! And one told long stories, and one
was stodgy, and one opened his wife’s letters
before she was down!”</p>

<p>“Tell me the attributes of a perfect husband,
then, that I may learn them,” he said.</p>

<p>“They have to pay all the bills.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could do that.”</p>

<p>“And they have not to interfere with one’s
movements. And one must be able to make
their hearts beat.”</p>

<p>“Well, you could do <i>that</i>!” and he bent
nearer to me. I drew back.</p>

<p>“And they have to take long journeys to
the Rocky Mountains for months together,
with men friends.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“There, you see!” I said, “the most important
part you don’t agree to. There is no
use talking further.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, there is! You have not said half
enough&mdash;have they to make your heart beat,
too?”</p>

<p>“You are hurting my hand.”</p>

<p>He dropped it.</p>

<p>“Have they?”</p>

<p>“Lady Ver said no husband could do that&mdash;the
fact of there being one kept your heart
quite quiet, and often made you yawn&mdash;but
she said it was not necessary, as long as you
could make theirs, so that they would do all
you asked.”</p>

<p>“Then do women’s hearts never beat&mdash;did
she tell you?”</p>

<p>“Of course they beat! How simple you
are for thirty years old. They beat constantly
for&mdash;oh&mdash;for people who are not husbands.”</p>

<p>“That is the result of your observations,
is it? You are probably right, and I am a
fool.”</p>

<p>“Some one said at lunch yesterday that a
beautiful lady in Paris had her heart beating
for you,” I said, looking at him again.</p>

<p>He changed&mdash;so very little, it was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
start, or a wince even&mdash;just enough for me to
know he felt what I said.</p>

<p>“People are too kind,” he said. “But we
have got no nearer the point. When will you
marry me?”</p>

<p>“I shall marry you&mdash;never, Mr. Carruthers,”
I said, “unless I get into an old maid
soon, and no one else asks me. Then if you
go on your knees I may put out the tip of
my finger, perhaps!” and I moved towards
the door, making him a sweeping and polite
curtsey.</p>

<p>He rushed after me.</p>

<p>“Evangeline!” he exclaimed, “I am not
a violent man as a rule, indeed I am rather
cool, but you would drive any one perfectly
mad. Some day some one will strangle you&mdash;Witch!”</p>

<p>“Then I had better run away to save my
neck,” I said, laughing over my shoulder as
I opened the door and ran up the stairs, and
I peeped at him from the landing above.
He had come out into the hall. “Good-bye,”
I called, and without waiting to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Lady Ver he tramped down the stairs and
away.</p>

<p>“Evangeline, what <i>have</i> you been doing?”
she asked, when I got into her room, where
her maid was settling her veil before the glass,
and trembling over it&mdash;Lady Ver is sometimes
fractious with her, worse than I am
with Véronique, far.</p>

<p>“Evangeline, you look naughtier than ever;
confess at once.”</p>

<p>“I have been as good as gold,” I said.</p>

<p>“Then why are those two emeralds sparkling
so, may one ask?”</p>

<p>“They are sparkling with conscious virtue,”
I said, demurely.</p>

<p>“You have quarrelled with Mr. Carruthers.
Go away, Welby! Stupid woman, can’t you
see it catches my nose?”</p>

<p>Welby retired meekly (after she is cross
Lady Ver sends Welby to the theatre&mdash;Welby
adores her).</p>

<p>“Evangeline, how dare you! I see it all.
I gathered bits from Robert. You have quarrelled
with the very man you must marry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does Lord Robert know about me?”
I said. That made me angry.</p>

<p>“Nothing; he only said Mr. Carruthers
admired you at Branches.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“He is too attractive, Christopher! he is
one of the ‘married women’s pets,’ as Ada
Fairfax says, and has never spoken to a girl
before. You ought to be grateful we have let
him look at you!&mdash;minx!&mdash;instead of quarrelling,
as I can see you have.” She rippled with
laughter, while she pretended to scold me.</p>

<p>“Surely I may be allowed that chastened
diversion,” I said, “I can’t go to theatres!”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” she commanded, tapping
her foot.</p>

<p>But early in Mrs. Carruthers’ days, I learnt
that one is wiser when one keeps one’s own
affairs to oneself&mdash;so I fenced a little, and
laughed, and we went out to drive finally,
without her being any the wiser. Going into
the Park, we came upon a troop of the 3rd
Life Guards, who had been escorting the King
to open something, and there rode Lord Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in his beautiful clothes, and a floating plume&mdash;he
did look so lovely&mdash;and <i>my</i> heart suddenly
began to beat; I could feel it, and was ashamed,
and it did not console me greatly to reflect that
the emotion caused by a uniform is not confined
to nursemaids.</p>

<p>Of course, it must have been the uniform,
and the black horse&mdash;Lord Robert is nothing
to me. But I hate to think that mamma’s
mother having been nobody, I should have
inherited these common instincts.</p>

<p class="pr8 p1"><span class="smcap">300, Park Street</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4"><i>Thursday, November 24th.</i></p>
<p class="pr6"><i>Evening</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Merrenden</span> is so nice&mdash;one of those
kind faces that even a tight fringe in a net does
not spoil. She is tall and graceful, past fifty
perhaps, and has an expression of Lord Robert
about the eyes. At luncheon she was sweet to
me at once, and did not look as if she thought
I must be bad just because I have red hair, like
elderly ladies do generally.</p>

<p>I felt I wanted to be good and nice directly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
She did not allude to my desolate position, or
say anything without tact, but she asked me to
lunch, as if I had been a queen, and would
honour her by accepting. For some reason I
could see Lady Ver did not wish me to go,
she made all sorts of excuses about wanting
me herself, but also, for some reason, Lady
Merrenden was determined I should, and
finally settled it should be on Saturday, when
Lady Ver is going down to Northumberland
to her father’s, and I am going&mdash;where? Alas,
as yet I know not.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Lady Ver said old
people without dyed hair or bridge proclivities
were tiresome, and she smoked three
cigarettes, one after the other, as fast as she
could. (Welby is going to the theatre again
to-night!)</p>

<p>I said I thought Lady Merrenden was
charming. She snapped my head off, for the
first time, and then there was silence&mdash;but
presently she began to talk, and fix herself in
a most becoming way on the sofa&mdash;we were in
her own sitting-room, a lovely place, all blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
silk and French furniture, and attractive things.
She said she had a cold, and must stay indoors.
She had changed immediately into a tea-gown&mdash;but
I could not hear any cough.</p>

<p>“Charlie has just wired he comes back to-night,”
she announced at length.</p>

<p>“How nice for you!” I sympathized. “You
will be able to make his heart beat!”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact it is extremely inconvenient,
and I want you to be nice to him
and amuse him, and take his attention off me,
like a pet, Evangeline,” she cooed&mdash;and then,
“What a lovely afternoon for November! I
wish I could go for a walk in the Park,” she said.</p>

<p>I felt it would be cruel to tease her further,
and so announced my intention of taking
exercise in that way with the angels.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will do you good, dear child,” she
said, brightly, “and I will rest here, and take
care of my cold.”</p>

<p>“They have asked me to tea in the nursery,”
I said, “and I have accepted.”</p>

<p>“Jewel of a Snake-girl!” she laughed&mdash;she
is not thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know the Torquilstone history?”
she said, just as I was going out of the door.</p>

<p>I came back&mdash;why, I can’t imagine, but it
interested me.</p>

<p>“Robert’s brother&mdash;half-brother, I mean&mdash;the
Duke, is a cripple, you know, and he is
<i>toqué</i> on one point, too&mdash;their blue blood. He
will never marry, but he can cut Robert off
with almost the bare title if he displeases
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“Torquilstone’s mother was one of the
housemaids, the old Duke married her before
he was twenty-one, and she fortunately joined
her beery ancestors a year or so afterwards,
and then, much later, he married Robert’s
mother, Lady Ethelrida Fitz Walter&mdash;there
is sixteen years between them&mdash;Robert and
Torquilstone, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Then what is he <i>toqué</i> about blue blood
for, with a <i>tache</i> like that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That is just it. He thinks it is such a
disgrace, that even if he were not a humpback,
he says he would never marry to transmit this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
stain to the future Torquilstones&mdash;and if
Robert ever marries anyone without a pedigree
enough to satisfy an Austrian prince, he will
disown him, and leave every <i>sou</i> to charity.”</p>

<p>“Poor Lord Robert!” I said, but I felt my
cheeks burn.</p>

<p>“Yes, is it not tiresome for him? So, of
course, he cannot marry until his brother’s
death; there is almost no one in England
suitable.”</p>

<p>“It is not so sad after all,” I said, “there
is always the delicious <i>rôle</i> of the ‘married
woman’s pet’ open to him, isn’t there?” and
I laughed.</p>

<p>“Little cat!” but she wasn’t angry.</p>

<p>“I told you I only scratched when I was
scratched first,” I said, as I went out of the
room.</p>

<p>The angels had started for their walk, and
Véronique had to come with me at first to find
them. We were walking fast down the path
beyond Stanhope Gate, seeing their blue velvet
pelisses in the distance, when we met Mr.
Carruthers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped, and turned with me.</p>

<p>“Evangeline, I was so angry with you
yesterday,” he said, “I very nearly left London,
and abandoned you to your fate, but
now that I have seen you again&mdash;&mdash;” he
paused.</p>

<p>“You think Paris is a long way off!” I
said innocently.</p>

<p>“What have they been telling you?” he
said, sternly, but he was not quite comfortable.</p>

<p>“They have been saying it is a fine November,
and the Stock Exchange is no place to play
in, and if it were not for bridge, they would all
commit suicide! That is what we talk of at
Park Street.”</p>

<p>“You know very well what I mean. What
have they been telling you about me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that there is a charming
French lady, who adores you, and whom you
are devoted to&mdash;and I am so sympathetic&mdash;I
like French women, they put on their hats so
nicely.”</p>

<p>“What ridiculous gossip&mdash;I don’t think
Park Street is the place for you to stay. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
thought you had more mind than to chatter
like this.”</p>

<p>“I suit myself to my company!” I laughed,
and waited for Véronique, who had stopped
respectfully behind&mdash;she came up reluctantly.
She disapproves of all English unconventionality,
but she feels it her duty to encourage
Mr. Carruthers.</p>

<p>Should she run on, and stop the young
ladies? she suggested, pointing to the angels
in front.</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” said Mr. Carruthers, and before
I could prevent her, she was off.</p>

<p>Traitress! She was thinking of her own
comfortable quarters at Branches, I know!</p>

<p>The sharp, fresh air, got into my head. I
felt gay, and without care. I said heaps of
things to Mr. Carruthers, just as I had once
before to Malcolm, only this was much more
fun, because Mr. Carruthers isn’t a red-haired
Scotchman, and can see things.</p>

<p>It seemed a day of meetings, for when we
got down to the end, we encountered Lord
Robert, walking leisurely in our direction. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
looked as black as night when he caught sight
of us.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob!” said Mr. Carruthers, cheerfully.
“Ages since I saw you&mdash;will you come
and dine to-night? I have a box for this winter
opera that is on, and I am trying to persuade
Miss Travers to come. She says Lady Verningham
is not engaged to-night, she knows,
and we might dine quietly, and all go, don’t
you think so?”</p>

<p>Lord Robert said he would, but he added,
“Miss Travers would never come out before;
she said she was in too deep mourning.” He
seemed aggrieved.</p>

<p>“I am going to sit in the back of the box,
and no one will see me,” I said, “and I do love
music so.”</p>

<p>“We had better let Lady Verningham know
at once then,” said Mr. Carruthers.</p>

<p>Lord Robert announced he was going there
now, and would tell her.</p>

<p>I knew that! The blue tea-gown, with the
pink roses, and the lace cap, and the bad cold
were not for nothing. (I wish I had not written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
this, it is spiteful of me, and I am not spiteful
as a rule. It must be the east wind.)</p>

<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Thursday night, Nov. 24th.</i></p>

<p>“Now that you have embarked upon this,”
Lady Ver said, when I ventured into her
sitting-room, hearing no voices, about six
o’clock (Mr. Carruthers had left me at the
door, at the end of our walk, and I had been
with the angels at tea ever since), “Now that
you have embarked upon this opera, I say, you
will have to dine at Willis’s with us. I won’t
be in when Charlie arrives from Paris. A
windy day, like to-day, his temper is sure to
be impossible.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said.</p>

<p>Of what use after all for an adventuress like
me to have sensitive feelings.</p>

<p>“And I am leaving this house at a quarter to
seven. I wish you to know, Evangeline, pet!”
she called after me, as I flew off to dress.</p>

<p>As a rule Lady Ver takes a good hour to
make herself into the attractive darling she
is in the evening&mdash;she has not to do much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
because she is lovely by nature; but she potters,
and squabbles with Welby, to divert herself,
I suppose.</p>

<p>However, to-night, with the terror upon
her of a husband fresh from a rough Channel
passage, going to arrive at seven o’clock, she
was actually dressed and down in the hall
when I got there, punctually at 6.45, and in
the twinkle of an eye we were rolling in the
electric to Willis’s. I have only been there
once before, and that to lunch in Mrs. Carruthers’
days with some of the Ambassadors,
and it does feel gay going to a restaurant at
night. I felt more excited than ever in my life,
and such a situation, too.</p>

<p>Lord Robert&mdash;<i>fruit défendu!</i> and Mr. Carruthers
<i>empressé</i>, and to be kept in bounds!</p>

<p>More than enough to fill the hands of
a maiden of sixteen, fresh from a convent,
as old Count Someroff used to say when he
wanted to express a really difficult piece of
work.</p>

<p>They were waiting for us just inside the
door, and again I noticed that they were both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lovely creatures, and both exceptionally distinguished
looking.</p>

<p>Lady Ver nodded to a lot of people before we
took our seats in a nice little corner. She must
have an agreeable time with so many friends.
She said something which sounds so true in
one of our talks, and I thought of it then.</p>

<p>“It is wiser to marry the life you like,
because, after a little, the man doesn’t matter.”
She has evidently done that&mdash;but I wish it
could be possible to have both&mdash;the Man and
the Life!&mdash;Well! Well!</p>

<p>One has to sit rather close on those sofas,
and as Lord Robert was not the host, he was
put by me. The other two at a right angle to us.</p>

<p>I felt exquisitely gay&mdash;in spite of having
an almost high black dress on, and not even
any violets!</p>

<p>It was dreadfully difficult not to speak nicely
to my neighbour, his directness and simplicity
are so engaging, but I did try hard to concentrate
myself on Christopher, and leave him
alone&mdash;only I don’t know why&mdash;the sense of
his being so near me made me feel&mdash;I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
quite know what. However, I hardly spoke
to him, Lady Ver shall never say I did not
play fair, though insensibly even she herself
drew me into a friendly conversation, and
then Lord Robert looked like a happy schoolboy.</p>

<p>We had a delightful time.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers is a perfect host. He has all
the smooth and exquisite manners of the old
diplomats, without their false teeth and things.
I wish I were in love with him&mdash;or even I
wish something inside me would only let me
feel it was my duty to marry him; but it jumps
up at me every time I want to talk to myself
about it, and says “Absolutely impossible.”</p>

<p>When it came to starting for the opera,
“Mr. Carruthers will take you in his brougham,
Evangeline,” Lady Ver said, “and I
will be protected by Robert. Come along,
Robert!” as he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Lady Ver!” he said, “I would
love to come with you&mdash;but won’t it look
rather odd for Miss Evangeline to arrive alone
with Christopher. Consider his character!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ver darted a glance of flame at him,
and got into the electric; while Christopher,
without hesitation, handed me into his brougham.
Lord Robert and I were two puppets, a
part I do not like playing.</p>

<p>I was angry altogether. She would not have
dared to have left me to go like this, if I had
been any one who mattered. Mr. Carruthers
got in, and tucked his sable rug round me. I
never spoke a word for a long time, and
Covent Garden is not far off, I told myself. I
I can’t say why I had a sense of <i>malaise</i>.</p>

<p>There was a strange look in his face, as a
great lamp threw alight on it. “Evangeline,”
he said, in a voice I have not yet heard,
“when are you going to finish playing with
me&mdash;I am growing to love you, you know.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to hear it,” I said, gently.
“I don’t want you to&mdash;oh! please <i>don’t</i>!” as
he took my hand. “I&mdash;I&mdash;if you only knew
how I <i>hate</i> being touched!”</p>

<p>He leant back, and looked at me. There is
something which goes to the head a little about
being in a brougham with nice fur rugs, alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
with some one at night. The lights flashing in
at the windows, and that faint scent of a very
good cigar. I felt fearfully excited. If it had
been Lord Robert, I believe&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He leant over very close to me. It seemed
in another moment he would kiss me&mdash;and
what could I do then&mdash;I couldn’t scream, or
jump out in Leicester Square, could I?</p>

<p>“Why do you call me Evangeline?” I said,
by way of putting him off. “I never said you
might.”</p>

<p>“Foolish child&mdash;I shall call you what I
please. You drive me mad&mdash;I don’t know what
you were born for. Do you always have this
effect on people?”</p>

<p>“What effect?” I said, to gain time; we had
got nearly into Long Acre.</p>

<p>“An effect that causes one to lose all discretion.
I feel I would give my soul to hold
you in my arms.”</p>

<p>I told him I did not think it was at all nice
or respectful of him to talk so. That I found
such love revolting.</p>

<p>“You tell me in your sane moments I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
most unsuitable to you&mdash;you try to keep away
from me, and then, when you get close, you
begin to talk this stuff! I think it is an insult!”
I said, angry and disdainful. “When I
arouse devotion and tenderness in some one, then
I shall listen, but to you and to this&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>“Go on!” he said. “Even in the dim light
you look beautiful when cross.”</p>

<p>“I am not cross,” I answered. “Only absolutely
disgusted.”</p>

<p>By that time, thank goodness, we had got
into the stream of carriages close to the Opera
House. Mr. Carruthers, however, seemed
hardly to notice this.</p>

<p>“Darling,” he said, “I will try not to
annoy you, but you are so fearfully provoking.
I tell you truly, no man would find it
easy to keep cool with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know what it is being cool
or not cool!” I said, wearily. “I am tired of
every one, even as tiny a thing as Malcolm
Montgomerie gets odd like this!”</p>

<p>He leant back and laughed, and then said
angrily, “Impertinence! I will wring his neck!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank heaven we have arrived!” I exclaimed,
as we drove under the portico. I
gave a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Really, men are very trying and tiresome,
and if I shall always have to put up with these
scenes through having red hair, I almost wish
it were mouse coloured, like Cicely Parker’s.
Mrs. Carruthers often said, “You need not
suppose, Evangeline, that you are going to
have a quiet life with your colouring&mdash;the
only thing one can hope for is that you will
screw on your head.”</p>

<p>Lady Ver and Lord Robert were already
in the hall waiting for us, but the second
I saw them I knew she had been saying
something to Lord Robert, his face so gay
and <i>debonnaire</i> all through dinner, now looked
set and stern, and he took not the slightest
notice of me as we walked to the box, the big
one next the stage on the pit tier.</p>

<p>Lady Ver appeared triumphant; her eyes
were shining with big blacks in the middle,
and such bright spots of pink in her cheeks,
she looked lovely; and I can’t think why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
but I suddenly felt I hated her. It was
horrid of me, for she was so kind, and settled
me in the corner behind the curtain, where I
could see and not be seen, rather far back,
while she and Lord Robert were quite in the
front. It was “Carmen”&mdash;the opera. I have
never seen it before.</p>

<p>Music has such an effect&mdash;every note seems
to touch some emotion in me. I feel wicked, or
good, or exalted, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash; Oh, some queer
feeling that I don’t know what it is&mdash;a kind
of electric current down my back, and as if,
as if I would like to love some one, and have
them to kiss me. Oh! it sounds perfectly
dreadful what I have written&mdash;but I can’t help
it&mdash;that is what some music does to me, and
I said always I should tell the truth here.</p>

<p>From the very beginning note to the end I
was feeling&mdash;feeling. Oh, how I understand
her&mdash;Carmen!&mdash;<i>fruit défendu</i> attracted her
so&mdash;the beautiful, wicked, fascinating snake.
I also wanted to dance, and to move like that,
and I unconsciously quivered perhaps. I was
cold as ice, and fearfully excited. The back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Lord Robert’s beautifully set head impeded
my view at times. How exquisitely groomed
he is, and one could see at a glance <i>his</i> mother
had not been a housemaid. I never have seen
anything look so well bred as he does.</p>

<p>Lady Ver was talking to him in a cooing,
low voice, after the first act, and the
second act, and indeed even when the third
act had begun. He seemed much more <i>empressé</i>
with her than he generally does. It&mdash;it
hurt me&mdash;that and the music and the dancing,
and Mr. Carruthers whispering passionate
little words at intervals, even though I paid
no attention to them, but altogether I, too,
felt a kind of madness.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lord Robert turned round, and
for five seconds looked at me. His lovely
expressive blue eyes, swimming with wrath
and reproach, and&mdash;oh, how it hurt me!&mdash;contempt!
Christopher was leaning over the
back of my chair, quite close, in a devoted
attitude.</p>

<p>Lord Robert did not speak, but if a look
could wither, I must have turned into a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
oak leaf. It awoke some devil in me. What
had <i>I</i> done to be annihilated so! <i>I</i> was playing
perfectly fair&mdash;keeping my word to Lady
Ver, and oh! I felt as if it were breaking
my heart.</p>

<p>But that look of Lord Robert’s! It drove
me to distraction, and every instinct to be
wicked and attractive that I possess came
up in me. I leant over to Lady Ver, so
that I must be close to him, and I said little
things to her, never one word to him, but I
moved my seat, making it certain the corner
of his eye must catch sight of me, and I
allowed my shoulders to undulate the faintest
bit to that Spanish music. Oh, I can dance as
Carmen too! Mrs. Carruthers had me taught
every time we went to Paris, she loved to see
it herself.</p>

<p>I could hear Christopher breathing very
quickly. “My God!” he whispered. “A
man would go to hell for you.”</p>

<p>Lord Robert got up abruptly and went out
of the box.</p>

<p>Then it was as if Don Jose’s dagger plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
into my heart, not Carmen’s. That sounds
high flown, but I mean it&mdash;a sudden sick,
cold sensation, as if everything was numb.
Lady Ver turned round pettishly to Christopher.
“What on earth is the matter with Robert?”
she said.</p>

<p>“There is a Persian proverb which asserts
a devil slips in between two winds,” said
Christopher; “perhaps that is what has happened
in this box to-night.”</p>

<p>Lady Ver laughed harshly, and I sat there
still as death. And all the time the music
and the movement on the stage went on.
I am glad she is murdered in the end,
glad&mdash;&mdash;! Only I would like to have seen
the blood gush out. I am fierce&mdash;fierce&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">300, <span class="smcap">Park Street</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Friday morning, Nov. 25th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I know</span> just the meaning of dust and ashes&mdash;for
that is what I felt I had had for breakfast
this morning, the day after “Carmen.”</p>

<p>Lady Ver had given orders she was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to be disturbed, so I did not go near her,
and crept down to the dining-room, quite forgetting
the master of the house had arrived.
There he was&mdash;a strange, tall, lean man with
fair hair, and sad, cross, brown eyes, and a nose
inclined to pink at the tip&mdash;a look of indigestion
about him, I feel sure. He was sitting
in front of a “Daily Telegraph” propped up on
the tea-pot, and some cold, untasted sole on
his plate.</p>

<p>I came forward. He looked very surprised.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m Evangeline Travers,” I announced.</p>

<p>He said “How d’you do” awkwardly; one
could see without a notion what that meant.</p>

<p>“I’m staying here,” I continued. “Did you
not know?”</p>

<p>“Then won’t you have some breakfast&mdash;beastly
cold, I fear,” politeness forced him to
utter. “No&mdash;Ianthe never writes to me&mdash;I
had not heard any news for a fortnight, and I
have not seen her yet.”</p>

<p>Manners have been drummed into me from
early youth, so I said politely, “You only
arrived from Paris late last night, did you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I got in about seven o’clock, I think,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“We had to leave so early, we were going
to the Opera,” I said.</p>

<p>“A Wagner that begins at unearthly hours,
I suppose,” he murmured absently.</p>

<p>“No, it was ‘Carmen’&mdash;but we dined first
with my&mdash;my&mdash;guardian, Mr. Carruthers.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>We both ate for a little&mdash;the tea was greenish-black&mdash;and
lukewarm&mdash;no wonder he has
dyspepsia.</p>

<p>“Are the children in, I wonder,” he hazarded,
presently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said. “I went to the nursery and
saw them as I came down.”</p>

<p>At that moment the three angels burst into
the room, but came forward decorously, and
embraced their parent. They did not seem to
adore him like they do Lady Ver.</p>

<p>“Good morning, papa,” said the eldest, and
the other two repeated it in chorus. “We hope
you have slept well, and had a nice passage
across the sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>They evidently had been drilled outside!</p>

<p>Then, nature getting uppermost, they patted
him patronizingly.</p>

<p>“Daddie, darling, have you brought us any
new dolls from Paris?”</p>

<p>“And I want one with red hair, like Evangeline,”
said Yseult, the youngest.</p>

<p>Sir Charles seemed bored and uncomfortable;
he kissed his three exquisite bits of Dresden
china, so like, and yet unlike himself&mdash;they
have Lady Ver’s complexion, but brown eyes
and golden hair like him.</p>

<p>“Yes, ask Harbottle for the packages,” he
said. “I have no time to talk to you&mdash;tell your
mother I will be in for lunch,” and making
excuse to me for leaving so abruptly&mdash;an appointment
in the City&mdash;he shuffled out of the
room.</p>

<p>I wonder how Lady Ver makes his heart
beat. I <i>don’t</i> wonder she prefers&mdash;Lord
Robert.</p>

<p>“Why is papa’s nose so red?” said Yseult.</p>

<p>“Hush!” implored Mildred. “Poor papa
has come off the sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t love papa,” said Corisande, the
middle one. “He’s cross, and sometimes he
makes darling mummie cry.”</p>

<p>“We must always love papa,” chanted
Mildred, in a lesson voice. “We must always
love our parents, and grandmamma, and grandpapa,
and aunts and cousins&mdash;Amen.” The
“Amen” slipped out unawares, and she looked
confused and corrected herself when she had
said it.</p>

<p>“Let’s find Harbottle. Harbottle is papa’s
valet,” Corisande said, “and he is much
thoughtfuller than papa. Last time he brought
me a Highland boy doll, though papa had
forgotten I asked for it.”</p>

<p>They all three went out of the room, first
kissing me, and curtseying sweetly when
they got to the door. They are never rude,
or boisterous&mdash;the three angels, I love
them.</p>

<p>Left alone, I did feel like a dead fish. The
column “London Day by Day” caught my eye
in the “Daily Telegraph,” and I idly glanced
down it&mdash;not taking in the sense of the words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
until “The Duke of Torquilstone has arrived
at Vavasour House, St. James’s from abroad,”
I read.</p>

<p>Well, what did it matter to me; what did
anything matter to me? Lord Robert had met
us in the hall again, as we were coming out
of the Opera; he looked very pale, and he
apologized to Lady Ver for his abrupt departure.
He had got a chill, he said, and had
gone to have a glass of brandy, and was all
right now, and would we not come to supper,
and various other <i>empressé</i> things, looking at
her with the greatest devotion&mdash;I might not
have existed.</p>

<p>She was capricious, as she sometimes is.
“No, Robert, I am going home to bed. I have
got a chill too,” she said.</p>

<p>And the footman announcing the electric
at that moment, we flew off, and left them.
Christopher having fastened my sable collar
with an air of possession, which would have
irritated me beyond words at another time, but
I felt cold and dead, and utterly numb.</p>

<p>Lady Ver did not speak a word on the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
back, and kissed me frigidly as she went in
to her room&mdash;then she called out:</p>

<p>“I am tired, Snake-girl&mdash;don’t think I am
cross&mdash;good-night!” and so I crept up to bed.</p>

<p>To-morrow is Saturday, and my visit ends.
After my lunch with Lady Merrenden I am a
wanderer on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Where shall I wander to&mdash;I feel I want to
go away by myself&mdash;away where I shall not see
a human being who is English. I want to forget
what they look like&mdash;I want to shut out
of my sight their well-groomed heads&mdash;I want,
oh, I do not know what I do want.</p>

<p>Shall I marry Mr. Carruthers? He would
eat me up, and then go back to Paris to the
lady he loves&mdash;but I should have the life I like&mdash;and
the Carruthers’ emeralds are beautiful&mdash;and
I love Branches&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Her ladyship would like to see you,
Miss,” said a footman.</p>

<p>So I went up the stairs.</p>

<p>Lady Ver was in a darkened room, soft pink
blinds right down beyond the half-drawn blue
silk curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a fearful head, Evangeline,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Then I will smooth your hair,” and I
climbed up beside her, and began to run over
her forehead with the tips of my fingers.</p>

<p>“You are really a pet, Snake-girl,” she said,
“and you can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help what?”</p>

<p>“Being a witch. I knew you would hurt
me, when I first saw you, and I tried to protect
myself by being kind to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Lady Ver!” I said, deeply moved.
“I would not hurt you for the world, and indeed,
you misjudge me; I have kept the
bargain to the very letter and&mdash;spirit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you have to the letter, at
least&mdash;but why did Robert go out of the box
last night?” she demanded, wearily.</p>

<p>“He said he had got a chill, did not he?”
I replied, lamely. She clasped her hands
passionately.</p>

<p>“A chill!!! You don’t know Robert! he
never had a chill in his life,” she said. “Oh, he
is the dearest, dearest being in the world. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
makes me believe in good and all things honest.
He isn’t vicious, he isn’t a prig, and he knows
the world, and he lives in its ways like the rest
of us, and yet he doesn’t begin by thinking
every woman is fair game, and undermining
what little self-respect she may have left to her.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” I said. I found nothing else to say.</p>

<p>“If I had had a husband like that I would
never have yawned,” she went on, “and, besides,
Robert is too masterful, and would be too
jealous to let one divert oneself with another.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said again, and continued to
smooth her forehead.</p>

<p>“He has sentiment, too&mdash;he is not matter-of-fact
and brutal&mdash;and oh, you should see him
on a horse, he is too, too beautiful!” She
stretched out her arms in a movement of weariness
that was pathetic, and touched me.</p>

<p>“You have known him a long, long time?”
I said, gently.</p>

<p>“Perhaps five years, but only casually until
this season. I was busy with some one else
before. I have played with so many.” Then she
roused herself up. “But Robert is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
one who has never made love to me. Always
dear and sweet and treating me like a queen, as
if I were too high for that, and having his own
way, and not caring a pin for any one’s opinion.
And I have wanted him to make love to me
often. But now I realize it is no use. Only
you sha’n’t have him, Snake-girl! I told him
as we were going to the Opera you were as
cold as ice, and were playing with Christopher,
and I am going to take him down to Northumberland
with me to-morrow out of your
way. He shall be my devoted friend at any
rate. You would break his heart, and I shall
still hold you to your promise.”</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>“Do you hear, I say <i>you</i> would break his
heart. He would be only capable of loving
straight to the end. The kind of love any
other woman would die for, but you&mdash;you
are Carmen.”</p>

<p>At all events not <i>she</i>, nor any other woman,
shall ever see what I am, or am not. My heart
is not for them to peck at. So I said, calmly:</p>

<p>“Carmen was stabbed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“And serve her right! Fascinating, fiendish
demon!” Then she laughed, her mood changing.</p>

<p>“Did you see Charlie?” she said.</p>

<p>“We breakfasted together.”</p>

<p>“Cheerful person, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “He looked cross and ill.”</p>

<p>“Ill!” she said, with a shade of anxiety.
“Oh, you only mean dyspeptic.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Well, he always does when he comes from
Paris. If you could go into his room, and see
the row of photographs on his mantelpiece,
you might guess why.”</p>

<p>“Pictures of ‘Sole Dieppoise’ and ‘Poulet
Victoria aux truffes,’ no doubt,” I hazarded.</p>

<p>She doubled up with laughter. “Yes, just
that!” she said. “Well, he adores me in his
way, and will bring me a new Cartier ring to
make up for it&mdash;you will see at luncheon.”</p>

<p>“He is a perfect husband, then?”</p>

<p>“About the same as you will find Christopher.
Only Christopher will start by being an
exquisite lover, there is nothing he does not
know, and Charlie has not an idea of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
part. Heavens! the dullness of my honeymoon!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carruthers said all honeymoons
were only another parallel to going to the
dentist, or being photographed. Necessary evils
to be got through for the sake of the results.”</p>

<p>“The results!”</p>

<p>“Yes; the nice house, and the jewels, and
the other things.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes, I suppose she was right, but if
one had married Robert one would have had
both.” She did not say both what, but oh! I
knew.</p>

<p>“You think Mr. Carruthers will make a
fair husband, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You will never really know Christopher.
I have been acquainted with him for years.
You will never feel he would tell you the
whole truth about anything. He is an epicure
and an analyst of sensations; I don’t know if
he has any gods, he does not believe in them
if he has, he believes in no one, and nothing,
but perhaps himself. He is violently in love
with you for the moment, and he wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
marry you because he cannot obtain you on
any other terms.”</p>

<p>“You are flattering,” I said, rather hurt.</p>

<p>“I am truthful. You will probably have a
delightful time with him, and keep him devoted
to you for years, because you are not
in love with him, and he will take good care
you do not look at any one else. I can imagine
if one were in love with Christopher he would
break one’s heart, as he has broken poor
Alicia Verney’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but how silly! people don’t have
broken hearts now; you are talking like out of
a book, dear Lady Ver.”</p>

<p>“There are a few cases of broken hearts,
but they are not for book reasons&mdash;of death
and tragedy, etc.; they are because we cannot
have what we want, or keep what we have,”
and she sighed.</p>

<p>We did not speak for a few minutes, then
she said quite gaily,</p>

<p>“You have made my head better, your
touch is extraordinary; in spite of all I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
you, Snake-girl. You are not found on every
gooseberry bush.”</p>

<p>We kissed lightly, and I left her and went
to my room.</p>

<p>Yes, the best thing I can do is to marry
Christopher; I care for him so little that the
lady in Paris won’t matter to me, even if she
is like Sir Charles’s Poulet à la Victoria aux
truffes. He is such a gentleman, he will at
least be kind to me and refined and considerate;
and the Carruthers’ emeralds are divine, and
just my stones. I shall have them reset by
Cartier. The lace, too, will suit me, and the
sables, and I shall have the suite that Mrs.
Carruthers used at Branches done up with
pale green, and burn all the Early Victorians.
And no doubt existence will be full of
triumphs and pleasure.</p>

<p>But oh! I wish, I wish it were possible to
obtain “both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr2 p1">300, <span class="smcap">Park Street</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4"><i>Friday night</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luncheon</span> passed off very well. Sir Charles
returned from the City improved in temper,
and, as Lady Ver had predicted, presented her
with a Cartier jewel. It was a brooch, not
a ring, but she was delighted, and purred
to him.</p>

<p>He was a little late and we were seated, a
party of eight, when he came in. They all
chaffed him about Paris, and he took it quite
good-humouredly&mdash;he even seemed pleased.
He has no wit, but he looks like a gentleman,
and I daresay as husbands go he is suitable.</p>

<p>I am getting quite at home in the world,
and can talk to any one. I listen and I do not
talk much, only when I want to say something
that makes them think.</p>

<p>A very nice man sat next me to-day, he
reminded me of the old generals at Branches.
We had quite a war of wits, and it stimulated
me.</p>

<p>He told me, among other things, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
discovered who I was, that he had known
papa&mdash;papa was in the same Guards with him&mdash;and
that he was the best-looking man of
his day. Numbers of women were in love
with him, he said, but he was a faithless being
and rode away.</p>

<p>“He probably enjoyed himself, don’t you
think so? and he had the good luck to die in
his zenith,” I said.</p>

<p>“He was once engaged to Lady Merrenden,
you know. She was Lady Sophia Vavasour
then, and absolutely devoted to him, but Mrs.
Carruthers came between them and carried him
off; she was years older than he was, too, and
as clever as paint.”</p>

<p>“Poor papa seems to have been a weak
creature, I fear.”</p>

<p>“All men are weak,” he said.</p>

<p>“And then he married and left Mrs. Carruthers,
I suppose?” I asked. I wanted to hear
as much as I could.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;e&mdash;s,” said my old Colonel. “I was
best man at the wedding&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what was she like, my mamma?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“She was the loveliest creature I ever saw,”
he said; “as lovely as you, only you are the
image of your father, all but the hair, his was
fair.”</p>

<p>“No one has ever said I was lovely before.
Oh! I am so glad if you think so,” I said.
It did please me. I have often been told I am
attractive and extraordinary, and wonderful,
and divine&mdash;but never just lovely. He would
not say any more about my parents, except
they hadn’t a <i>sou</i> to live on, and were not
very happy; Mrs. Carruthers took care of that.</p>

<p>Then, as every one was going, he said: “I
am awfully glad to have met you&mdash;we must
be pals, for the sake of old times,” and he gave
me his card for me to keep his address, and
told me if ever I wanted a friend to send him
a line, Colonel Tom Carden, The Albany.</p>

<p>I promised I would.</p>

<p>“You might give me away at my wedding,”
I said, gaily. “I am thinking of getting married,
some day!”</p>

<p>“That I will,” he promised, “and, by Jove,
the man will be a fortunate fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ver and I drove after luncheon&mdash;we
paid some calls, and went in to tea with the
Montgomeries, who had just arrived at Brown’s
Hotel for a week’s shopping.</p>

<p>“Aunt Katherine brings those poor girls up
always at this time, and takes them to some
impossible old dressmaker of her own, in
the day, and to Shakespeare, or a concert, at
night, and returns with them equipped in more
hideous garments each year. It is positively
cruel,” said Lady Ver, as we went up the stairs
to their <i>appartement</i>.</p>

<p>There they were, sitting round the tea-table,
just as at Tryland. Kirstie and Jean embroidering
and knitting, and the other two reading
new catalogues of books for their work!!!</p>

<p>Lady Ver began to tease them. She asked
them all sorts of questions about their new
frocks, and suggested they had better go to
Paris, once in a way. Lady Katherine was like
ice. She strongly disapproved of my being
with her niece, one could see.</p>

<p>The connection with the family, she hoped,
would be ended with my visit to Tryland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Malcolm was arriving in town, too, we gathered,
and Lady Ver left a message to ask him
to dine to-night.</p>

<p>Then we got away.</p>

<p>“If one of those lumps of suet had a spark
of spirit, it would go straight to the devil,”
Lady Ver said, as we went down the stairs.
“Think of it! ties and altar-cloths in London!
Mercifully they could not dine to-night.
I had to ask them, and they generally
come once while they are up&mdash;the four girls
and Aunt Katherine&mdash;and it is with the greatest
difficulty I can collect four young men for
them if they get the least hint who they are
to meet. I generally secure a couple of socially
budding Jews, because I feel the subscriptions
for their charities, which they will pester whoever
they do sit next for, are better filched
from the Hebrew, than from some pretty
needy guardsman. Oh, what a life!”</p>

<p>She was so kind to me on the way back;
she said she hated leaving me alone on the
morrow, and that I must settle now what I was
going to do, or she would not go. I said I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would go to Claridge’s where Mrs. Carruthers
and I had always stayed, and remain perfectly
quietly alone with Véronique. I could afford
it for a week. So we drove there, and made
the arrangement.</p>

<p>“It is absolutely impossible for you to go
on like this, dear child,” she said. “You must
have a chaperon; you are far too pretty to
stay alone in a hotel. What <i>can</i> I do for you?”</p>

<p>I felt so horribly uncomfortable, I was really
at my wits’ end. Oh! it is no fun being an
adventuress, after all, if you want to keep your
friends of the world as well.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it won’t matter if I don’t see any
one for a few days,” I said. “I will write to
Paris; my old Mademoiselle is married there
to a flourishing poet, I believe; perhaps she
would take me as a paying guest for a little.”</p>

<p>“That is very visionary&mdash;a French poet!
horrible, long-haired, frowsy creature. Impossible!
Surely you see how necessary it is
for you to marry Christopher as soon as you
can, Evangeline, don’t you?” she said, and I
was obliged to admit there were reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“The truth is, you can’t be the least eccentric,
or unconventional, if you are good-looking
and unmarried,” she continued; “you
may snap your fingers at Society, but if you
do, you won’t have a good time, and all the
men will either foolishly champion you, or be
impertinent to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I realize it,” I said, and there was a
lump in my throat.</p>

<p>“I shall write to Christopher to-morrow,”
she went on, “and thank him for our outing
last night, and I shall say something nice about
you, and your loneliness, and that he, as a kind
of relation, may go and see you on Sunday, as
long as he doesn’t make love to you, and he can
take you to the Zoo&mdash;don’t see him in your
sitting-room. That will give him just the extra
fillip, and he will go, and you will be demure,
and then, by those stimulating lions’ and tigers’
cages, you can plight your troth. It will be
quite respectable. Wire to me at once on
Monday, to Sedgwick, and you must come
back to Park Street directly I return on Thursday,
if it is all settled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>I thanked her as well as I could. She was
quite ingenuous, and quite sincere. I should
be a welcome guest as Christopher’s <i>fiancée</i>,
and there was no use my feeling bitter about
it&mdash;she was quite right.</p>

<p>As I put my hand on Malcolm’s skinny arm
going down to the dining-room, the only consolation
was my fate has not got to be him!
I would rather be anything in the world than
married to that!</p>

<p>I tried to be agreeable to Sir Charles. We
were only a party of six. An old Miss Harpenden,
who goes everywhere to play bridge,
and Malcolm, and one of Lady Ver’s young
men, and me. Sir Charles is absent, and brings
himself back; he fiddles with the knives and
forks, and sprawls on the table rather, too. He
looks at Lady Ver with admiration in his eyes.
It is true then, in the intervals of Paris, I
suppose, she can make his heart beat.</p>

<p>Malcolm made love to me after dinner. We
were left to talk when the others sat down to
bridge in the little drawing-room.</p>

<p>“I missed you so terribly, Miss Travers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>”
he said, priggishly, “when you left us, that I
realized I was extremely attracted by you.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t say so!” I said, innocently.
“Could one believe a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, earnestly. “You may indeed
believe it.”</p>

<p>“Do not say it so suddenly, then,” I said,
turning my head away, so that he could not
see how I was laughing. “You see, to a red-haired
person like me these compliments go to
my head.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not want to flurry you,” he said,
affably. “I know I have been a good deal
sought after&mdash;perhaps on account of my possessions”
(this with arrogant modesty), “but
I am willing to lay everything at your feet if
you will marry me.”</p>

<p>“Everything!” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything.”</p>

<p>“You are too good, Mr. Montgomerie&mdash;but
what would your mother say?”</p>

<p>He looked uneasy, and slightly unnerved.</p>

<p>“My mother, I fear, has old-fashioned
notions&mdash;but I am sure if you went to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
dressmaker&mdash;you&mdash;you would look different.”</p>

<p>“Should you like me to look different then&mdash;you
wouldn’t recognize me, you know, if I
went to her dressmaker.”</p>

<p>“I like you just as you are,” he said, with
an air of great condescension.</p>

<p>“I am overcome,” I said, humbly; “but&mdash;but&mdash;what
is this story I hear about Miss
Angela Grey? A lady, I see in the papers, who
dances at&mdash;the Gaiety, is it not? Are you sure
she will permit you to make this declaration
without her knowledge?”</p>

<p>He became petrified.</p>

<p>“Who has told you about her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No one,” I said. “Jean said your father
was angry with you on account of a horse of
that name, but I chanced to see it in the list of
attractions at the Gaiety&mdash;so I conclude it is
not a horse, and if you are engaged to her, I
don’t think it is quite right of you to try and
break my heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Evangeline&mdash;Miss Travers”&mdash;he
spluttered. “I am greatly attached to you&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
other was only a pastime&mdash;a&mdash;oh! we
men you know&mdash;young and&mdash;and&mdash;run after&mdash;have
our temptations you know. You must
think nothing about it. I will never see her
again, except just finally to say good-bye. I
promise you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I could not do a mean thing like that,
Mr. Montgomerie,” I said. “You must not
think of behaving so on my account&mdash;I am
not altogether heartbroken, you know&mdash;in
fact I rather think of getting married myself.”</p>

<p>He bounded up.</p>

<p>“Oh! you have deceived me then!” he said,
in self-righteous wrath. “After all I said to
you that evening at Tryland, and what you
promised then! Yes, you have grossly deceived
me.”</p>

<p>I could not say I had not listened to a word
he had said that night, and was utterly unconscious
of what I had promised. Even his self-appreciation
did not deserve such a blow as
this! so I softened my voice, and natural anger
at his words, and said quite gently,</p>

<p>“Do not be angry. If I have unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
given you a wrong impression, I am sorry, but
if one came to talking of deceiving, you have
deceived me about Miss Grey, so do not let
us speak further upon the matter. We are
quits. Now, won’t you be friends, as you have
always been”&mdash;and I put out my hand, and
smiled frankly in his face. The mean little
lines in it relaxed&mdash;he pulled himself together
and took my hand, and pressed it warmly. From
which I knew there was more in the affair of
Angela Grey than met the eye.</p>

<p>“Evangeline,” he said. “I shall always love
you, but Miss Grey is an estimable young
woman, there is not a word to be said against
her moral character&mdash;and I have promised her
my hand in marriage&mdash;so perhaps we had better
say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” I said, “but I consider I have
every reason to feel insulted by your offer,
which was not, judging from your subsequent
remarks, worth a moment’s thought!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I love you!” he said, and by his
face, for the time, this was probably true. So
I did not say any more, and we rose and joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the bridge players. And I contrived that he
should not speak to me again alone before he
said good-night.</p>

<p>“Did Malcolm propose to you,” Lady Ver
asked, as we came up to bed. “I thought I
saw a look in his eye at dinner.”</p>

<p>I told her he had done it in a kind of way,
with a reservation in favour of Miss Angela
Grey.</p>

<p>“That is too dreadful!” she said. “There
is a regular epidemic in some of the Guards’
regiments just now to marry these poor common
things with high moral characters, and&mdash;indifferent
feet! but I should have thought
the cuteness of the Scot would have protected
Malcolm from their designs. Poor Aunt
Katherine!”</p>

<p class="pr4 p1"><span class="smcap">Claridge’s</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Saturday, Nov. 26th</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Ver</span> went off early to the station,
to catch her train to Northumberland this
morning, and I hardly saw her to say good-bye.
She seemed out of temper too, on
getting a note, she did not tell me whom it
was from, or what it was about&mdash;only she said
immediately after, that I was not to be stupid.
“Do not play with Christopher further,” she
said, “or you will lose him. He will certainly
go and see you to-morrow&mdash;he wrote to me
this morning in answer to mine of last night&mdash;but
he says he won’t go to the Zoo&mdash;so you
will have to see him in your sitting-room after
all&mdash;he will come about four.”</p>

<p>I did not speak.</p>

<p>“Evangeline,” she said, “promise me you
won’t be a fool&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;won’t be a fool,” I said.</p>

<p>Then she kissed me, and was off, and a few
moments after I also started for Claridge’s.</p>

<p>I have a very nice little suite right up at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
top, and if only it were respectable for me, and
I could afford it, I could live here very comfortably
by myself for a long time.</p>

<p>At a quarter to two I was ringing the bell at
200, Carlton House Terrace, Lady Merrenden’s
House&mdash;with a strange feeling of excitement
and interest. Of course it must have been
because once she had been engaged to papa.
In the second thoughts take to flash I remembered
Lord Robert’s words when I talked of
coming to London alone at Branches; how he
would bring me here, and how she would be
kind to me until I could “hunt round.”</p>

<p>Oh! it came to me with a sudden stab. He
was leaning over Lady Ver in the northern
train by now.</p>

<p>Such a stately beautiful hall it is&mdash;when the
doors open&mdash;with a fine staircase going each
way, and full of splendid pictures, and the
whole atmosphere pervaded with an air of refinement
and calm.</p>

<p>The footmen are tall, and not too young,
and even at this time of the year have powdered
hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Merrenden was upstairs in the small
drawing-room, and she rose to meet me, a book
in her hand, when I was announced.</p>

<p>Her manners are so beautiful in her own
home; gracious, and not the least patronizing.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you,” she said. “I
hope you won’t be bored, but I have not asked
any one to meet you&mdash;only my nephew, Torquilstone,
is coming&mdash;he is a great sufferer,
poor fellow, and numbers of faces worry him,
at times.”</p>

<p>I said I was delighted to see her alone. No
look more kind could be expressed in a human
countenance than is expressed in hers. She has
the same exceptional appearance of breeding
that Lord Robert has, tiny ears, and wrists,
and head&mdash;even dressed as a charwoman, Lady
Merrenden would look like a great lady.</p>

<p>Very soon we were talking without the least
restraint; she did not speak of people, or of
very deep things, but it gave one the impression
of an elevated mind, and a knowledge of books,
and wide thoughts. Oh! I could love her so
easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>We had been talking for nearly a quarter of
an hour&mdash;she had incidentally asked me where
I was staying now, and had not seemed surprised
or shocked when I said Claridge’s, and
by myself.</p>

<p>All she said was: “What a lonely little girl!
but I daresay it is very restful sometimes to be
by oneself, only you must let your friends come
and see you, won’t you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I have any friends,” I said.
“You see I have been out so little&mdash;but if you
would come and see me&mdash;oh! I should be so
grateful.”</p>

<p>“Then you must count me as one of your
rare friends!” she said.</p>

<p>Nothing could be so rare, or so sweet, as
her smile. Fancy papa throwing over this
angel for Mrs. Carruthers!! Men are certainly
unaccountable creatures.</p>

<p>I said I would be too honoured to have her
for a friend&mdash;and she took my hand.</p>

<p>“You bring back the long ago,” she
said. “My name is Evangeline, too. Sophia
Evangeline&mdash;and I sometimes think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
may have been called so in remembrance of
me.”</p>

<p>What a strange, powerful factor Love must
be! Here these two women, Mrs. Carruthers
and Lady Merrenden&mdash;the very opposites of
each other&mdash;had evidently both adored papa,
and both, according to their natures, had taken
an interest in me, in consequence, the child of
a third woman, who had superseded them both!
Papa must have been extraordinarily fascinating
for, to the day of her death, Mrs. Carruthers
had his miniature on her table, with a fresh
rose beside it&mdash;his memory the only soft spot,
it seemed, in her hard heart.</p>

<p>And this sweet lady’s eyes melted in tenderness
when she spoke of the long ago&mdash;although
she does not know me well enough yet to say
anything further. To me papa’s picture is nothing
so very wonderful, just a good-looking
young guardsman, with eyes shaped like mine,
only gray, and light curly hair. He must
have had “a way with him” as the servants say.</p>

<p>At that moment the Duke of Torquilstone
came in. Oh, such a sad sight!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>A poor hump-backed man, with a strong
face and head, and a soured, suspicious, cynical
expression. He would evidently have been
very tall, but for his deformity, a hump stands
out on his back, almost like Mr. Punch. He
can’t be much over forty, but he looks far
older, his hair is quite gray.</p>

<p>Not a line, or an expression in him reminded
me of Lord Robert, I am glad to say.</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden introduced us, and Lord
Merrenden came in then, too, and we all went
down to luncheon.</p>

<p>It was a rather small table, so we were all
near one another, and could talk.</p>

<p>The dining-room is immense.</p>

<p>“I always have this little table when we are
such a small party,” Lady Merrenden said.
“It is more cosy, and one does not feel so
isolated.”</p>

<p>How I agreed with her.</p>

<p>The Duke looked at me searchingly often,
with his shrewd little eyes. One could not say
if it was with approval, or disapproval.</p>

<p>Lord Merrenden talked about politics, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the questions of the day, he has a courteous
manner, and all their voices are soft and refined.
And nothing could have been more
smooth and silent than the service.</p>

<p>The luncheon was very simple, and very
good, but not half the numbers of rich dishes
like at Branches, or Lady Ver’s.</p>

<p>There was only one bowl of violets on the
table, but the bowl was gold, and a beautiful
shape, and the violets nearly as big as pansies.
My eyes wandered to the pictures&mdash;Gainsborough’s,
and Reynolds’, and Romney’s&mdash;of
stately men and women.</p>

<p>“You met my other nephew, Lord Robert,
did you not?” Lady Merrenden said, presently.
“He told me he had gone to Branches,
where I believe you lived.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, and oh! it is too humiliating
to write, I felt my cheeks get crimson at the
mention of Lord Robert’s name. What could
she have thought? Can anything be so young
ladylike and ridiculous.</p>

<p>“He came to the Opera with us the night
before last,” I continued. “Mr. Carruthers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
had a box, and Lady Verningham and I went
with them.” Then recollecting how odd this
must sound in my deep mourning, I added,
“I am so fond of music.”</p>

<p>“So is Robert,” she said. “I am sure he
must have been pleased to meet a kindred
spirit there.”</p>

<p>Sweet, charming, kind lady! If she only
knew what emotions were really agitating us
in that box that night&mdash;I fear the actual love
of music was the least of them!</p>

<p>The Duke, during this conversation, and
from the beginning mention of Lord Robert’s
name, never took his eyes off my face&mdash;it was
very disconcerting; his look was clearer now,
and it was certainly disapproving.</p>

<p>We had coffee upstairs, out of such exquisite
Dresden cups, and then Lord Merrenden
showed me some miniatures. Finally it happened
that the Duke and I were left alone for a
minute looking out of a window on to the Mall.</p>

<p>His eyes pierced me through and through&mdash;well
at all events my nose and my ears and
my wrists are as fine as Lady Merrenden’s&mdash;poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
mamma’s odd mother does not show in
me on the outside&mdash;thank goodness. He did
not say much, only commonplaces about the
view. I felt afraid of him, and rather depressed.
I am sure he dislikes me.</p>

<p>“May I not drive you somewhere?” my
kind hostess asked. “Or, if you have nowhere
in particular to go, will you come with me?”</p>

<p>I said I should be delighted. An ache of
loneliness was creeping over me. I wanted to
put off as long as possible getting back to the
hotel. I wanted to distract my thoughts from
dwelling upon to-morrow, and what I was
going to say to Christopher. To-morrow that
seems the end of the world.</p>

<p>She has beautiful horses, Lady Merrenden,
and the whole turn-out, except she herself, is
as smart as can be. She really looks a little
frumpish out of doors, and perhaps that is why
papa went on to Mrs. Carruthers. Goodness and
dearness like this do not suit male creatures
as well as caprice, it seems.</p>

<p>She was so good to me, and talked in the
nicest way. I quite forgot I was a homeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
wanderer, and arrived at Claridge’s about half
past four in almost good spirits.</p>

<p>“You won’t forget I am to be one of your
friends,” Lady Merrenden said, as I bid her
good-bye.</p>

<p>“Indeed I won’t,” I replied, and she drove
off, smiling at me.</p>

<p>I do wonder what she will think of my
marriage with Christopher.</p>

<p>Now it is night&mdash;I have had a miserable,
lonely dinner in my sitting-room, Véronique
has been most gracious and coddling&mdash;she feels
Mr. Carruthers in the air, I suppose,&mdash;and so
I must go to bed.</p>

<p>Oh! why am I not happy, and why don’t I
think this is a delightful and unusual situation,
as I once would have done. I only feel
depressed and miserable, and as if I wished
Christopher at the bottom of the sea. I have
told myself how good-looking he is&mdash;and how
he attracted me at Branches&mdash;but that was
before&mdash;yes, I may as well write what I was
going to&mdash;before Lord Robert arrived. Well,
he and Lady Ver are talking together on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
nice sofa by now, I suppose, in a big, well-lit
drawing-room, and&mdash;oh!&mdash;I wish, I <i>wish</i> I
had never made any bargain with her&mdash;perhaps
now in that case&mdash;ah well&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Sunday afternoon.</i></p>

<p>No! I can’t bear it. All the morning I
have been in a fever, first hot and then cold.
What will it be like. Oh! I shall faint when
he kisses me. And I know he will be dreadful
like that, I have seen it in his eye&mdash;he will
eat me up. Oh! I am sure I shall hate it. No
man has ever kissed me in my life, and I can’t
judge, but I am sure it is frightful, unless&mdash;&mdash;I
feel as if I shall go crazy if I stay here any
longer. I can’t, I can’t stop and wait, and
face it. I must have some air first. There is
a misty fog. I would like to go out and get
lost in it, and I <i>will</i> too! Not get lost, perhaps,
but go out in it, and alone. I won’t
have even Véronique. I shall go by myself into
the Park. It is growing nearly dark, though
only three o’clock. I have got an hour. It
looks mysterious, and will soothe me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
suit my mood, and then, when I come in
again, I shall perhaps be able to bear it bravely,
kisses and all.</p>


<p class="pr6 p1"><span class="smcap">Claridge’s</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Sunday evening, November 27th.</i></p>

<p>I have a great deal to write&mdash;and yet it is
only a few hours since I shut up this book,
and replaced the key on my bracelet.</p>

<p>By a quarter past three I was making my
way through Grosvenor Square. Everything
was misty and blurred, but not actually a thick
fog, or any chance of being lost. By the time
I got into the Park it had lifted a little. It
seemed close and warm, and as I went on I got
more depressed. I have never been out alone
before; that in itself seemed strange, and ought
to have amused me.</p>

<p>The image of Christopher kept floating in
front of me, his face seemed to have the expression
of a satyr. Well, at all events, he
would never be able to break my heart like
“Alicia Verney’s”&mdash;nothing could ever make
me care for him. I tried to think of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
good I was going to get out of the affair, and
how really fond I am of Branches.</p>

<p>I walked very fast, people loomed at me,
and then disappeared in the mist. It was getting
almost dusk, and suddenly I felt tired,
and sat down on a bench.</p>

<p>I had wandered into a side path where there
were no chairs. On the bench before mine I
I saw, as I passed, a tramp huddled up. I
wondered what his thoughts were, and if he
felt any more miserable than I did. I daresay
I was crouching in a depressed position
too.</p>

<p>Not many people went by, and every
moment it grew darker. In all my life, even
on the days when Mrs. Carruthers taunted me
about mamma being nobody, I have never felt
so wretched. Tears kept rising in my eyes,
and I did not even worry to blink them away.
Who would see me&mdash;and who in the world
would care if they did see.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was conscious that a very perfect
figure was coming out of the mist towards
me, but not until he was close to me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
stopping with a start peered into my face, did
I recognize it was Lord Robert.</p>

<p>“Evangeline!” he exclaimed, in a voice of
consternation. “I&mdash;what, oh, what is the
matter?”</p>

<p>No wonder he was surprised. Why he had
not taken me for some tramp too, and passed
on, I don’t know.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I said, as well as I could, and
tried to tilt my hat over my eyes. I had no
veil on unfortunately.</p>

<p>“I have just been for a walk. Why do you
call me Evangeline, and why are you not in
Northumberland?”</p>

<p>He looked so tall and beautiful, and his face
had no expression of contempt or anger now,
only distress and sympathy.</p>

<p>“I was suddenly put on guard yesterday,
and could not get leave,” he said, not answering
the first part. “But, oh, I can’t bear to
see you sitting here alone, and looking so, so
miserable. Mayn’t I take you home? You
will catch cold in the damp.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, not yet. I won’t go back yet!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>”
I said, hardly realizing what I was saying. He
sat down beside me, and slipped his hand into
my muff, pressing my clasped fingers&mdash;the
gentlest, friendliest caress, a child might have
made in sympathy. It touched some foolish
chord in my nature, some want of self-control
inherited from mamma’s ordinary mother, I
suppose, anyway the tears poured down my
face&mdash;I could not help it. Oh, the shame of
it! to sit crying in the Park, in front of Lord
Robert, of all people in the world, too!</p>

<p>“Dear, dear little girl,” he said. “Tell me
about it,” and he held my hand in my muff
with his strong warm hand.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I have nothing to tell,” I said, choking
down a sob. “I am ashamed for you to
see me like this, only&mdash;I am feeling so very
miserable.”</p>

<p>“Dear child,” he said. “Well, you are not
to be&mdash;I won’t have it. Has some one been
unkind to you&mdash;tell me, tell me,” his voice
was trembling with distress.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s nothing,” I mumbled.</p>

<p>I dared not look at him, I knew his eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
would be up in that way that attracts me so
dreadfully.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he whispered almost, and bent
over me. “I want you to be friends with me
so that I can help you. I want you to go back
to the time we packed your books together.
God knows what has come between us since&mdash;it
is not of my doing&mdash;but I want to take care
of you, dear little girl to-day. It&mdash;oh, it
hurts me so to see you crying here.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;would like to be friends,” I said. “I
never wanted to be anything else, but I could
not help it&mdash;and I can’t now.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me the reason?” he pleaded.
“You have made me so dreadfully unhappy
about it. I thought all sorts of things. You
know I am a jealous beast.”</p>

<p>There can’t in the world be another voice
as engaging as Lord Robert’s, and he has a
trick of pronouncing words that is too attractive,
and the way his mouth goes when he is speaking,
showing his perfectly chiselled lips under
the little moustache! There is no use pretending!
I was sitting there on the bench going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
through thrills of emotion, and longing for
him to take me in his arms. It is too frightful
to think of! I must be bad after all.</p>

<p>“Now you are going to tell me everything
about it,” he commanded. “To begin with,
what made you suddenly change at Tryland
after the first afternoon, and then what is it
that makes you so unhappy now?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you either,” I said very low.
I hoped the common grandmother would not
take me as far as doing mean tricks to Lady
Ver!</p>

<p>“Oh, you have made me wild!” he exclaimed,
letting go my hand, and leaning both
elbows on his knees, while he pushed his hat
to the back of his head. “Perfectly mad with
fury and jealousy. That brute Malcolm! and
then looking at Campion at dinner, and worst
of all, Christopher in the box at ‘Carmen!’
Wicked, naughty little thing! And yet underneath
I have a feeling it is for some absurd
reason, and not for sheer devilment. If I
thought that, I would soon get not to care. I
did think it at ‘Carmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” I said.</p>

<p>“You know what?” he looked up, startled;
then he took my hand again, and sat close to
me.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, please don’t, Lord Robert!”
I said.</p>

<p>It really made me quiver so with the loveliest
feeling I have ever known, that I knew I should
never be able to keep my head if he went on.</p>

<p>“Please, please, don’t hold my hand,” I
said. “It&mdash;it makes me not able to behave
nicely.”</p>

<p>“Darling,” he whispered, “then it shows
that you like me, and I sha’n’t let go until you
tell me every little bit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, I can’t!” I felt too tortured,
and yet waves of joy were rushing over me.
That <i>is</i> a word, “darling,” for giving feelings
down the back!</p>

<p>“Evangeline,” he said, quite sternly, “will
you answer this question then&mdash;do you like
me, or do you hate me? Because, as you must
know very well, I love you.”</p>

<p>Oh, the wild joy of hearing him say that!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
What in the world did anything else matter!
For a moment there was a singing in my ears,
and I forgot everything but our two selves.
Then the picture of Christopher waiting for
me, with his cold, cynic’s face and eyes blazing
with passion, rushed into my vision, and
the Duke’s critical, suspicious, disapproving
scrutiny, and I felt as if a cry of pain, like a
wounded animal, escaped me.</p>

<p>“Darling, darling, what is it? Did I hurt
your dear little hand?” Lord Robert exclaimed
tenderly.</p>

<p>“No,” I whispered, brokenly; “but I cannot
listen to you. I am going back to Claridge’s
now, and I am going to marry Mr. Carruthers.”</p>

<p>He dropped my hand as if it stung him.</p>

<p>“Good God! Then it is true,” was all he said.</p>

<p>In fear I glanced at him&mdash;his face looked
gray in the quickly gathering mist.</p>

<p>“Oh, Robert!” I said in anguish, unable
to help myself. “It isn’t because I want to.
I&mdash;I&mdash;oh! probably I love you&mdash;but I must,
there is nothing else to be done.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there!” he said, all the life and joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
coming back to his face. “Do you think I
will let Christopher, or any other man in the
world, have you now you have confessed that!!”
and fortunately there was no one in sight&mdash;because
he put his arms round my neck, and
drew me close, and kissed my lips.</p>

<p>Oh, what nonsense people talk of heaven!
sitting on clouds and singing psalms and
things like that! There can’t be any heaven
half so lovely as being kissed by Robert&mdash;I
felt quite giddy with happiness for several
exquisite seconds, then I woke up. It was all
absolutely impossible, I knew, and I must keep
my head.</p>

<p>“Now you belong to me,” he said, letting
his arm slip down to my waist; “so you must
begin at the beginning, and tell me everything.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I said, struggling feebly to free
myself, and feeling so glad he held me tight!
“It is impossible all the same, and that only
makes it harder. Christopher is coming to see
me at four, and I promised Lady Ver I would
not be a fool, and would marry him.”</p>

<p>“A fig for Lady Ver,” he said, calmly, “if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
that is all; you leave her to me&mdash;she never
argues with me!”</p>

<p>“It is not only that&mdash;I&mdash;I promised I would
never play with you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you certainly never shall,” he said,
and I could see a look in his eye as he purposely
misconstrued my words, and then he
deliberately kissed me again. Oh! I like it
better than anything else in the world! How
could any one keep their head with Robert
quite close, making love like that?</p>

<p>“You certainly never&mdash;never&mdash;shall,” he
said again, with a kiss between each word. “I
will take care of that! Your time of playing
with people is over, Mademoiselle! When you
are married to me, I shall fight with any one
who dares to look at you!”</p>

<p>“But I shall never be married to you,
Robert,” I said, though, as I could only be
happy for such a few moments, I did not think
it necessary to move away out of his arms.
How thankful I was to the fog! and no one
passing! I shall always adore fogs.</p>

<p>“Yes, you will,” he announced, with perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
certainty; “in about a fortnight, I should
think. I can’t and won’t have you staying at
Claridge’s by yourself. I shall take you back
this afternoon to Aunt Sophia. Only all that
we can settle presently. Now, for the moment,
I want you to tell me you love me, and that
you are sorry for being such a little brute all
this time.”</p>

<p>“I did not know it until just now&mdash;but I
think&mdash;I probably do love you&mdash;Robert!” I
said.</p>

<p>He was holding my hand in my muff again,
the other arm round my waist. Absolutely
disgraceful behaviour in the Park; we might
have been Susan Jane and Thomas Augustus,
and yet I was perfectly happy, and felt it was
the only natural way to sit.</p>

<p>A figure appeared in the distance&mdash;we
started apart.</p>

<p>“Oh! really, really,” I gasped, “we&mdash;you&mdash;must
be different.”</p>

<p>He leant back and laughed.</p>

<p>“You sweet darling! Well, come, we will
go for a drive in a hansom&mdash;we will choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
one without a light inside. Albert Gate is quite
close, come!” and he rose, and taking my arm,
not offering his to me, like in books, he drew
me on down the path.</p>

<p>I am sure any one would be terribly shocked
to read what I have written, but not so much
if they knew Robert, and how utterly adorable
he is. And how masterful, and simple, and
direct! He does not split straws, or bandy
words. I had made the admission that I loved
him, and that was enough to go upon!</p>

<p>As we walked alone I tried to tell him
it was impossible, that I must go back to
Christopher, that Lady Ver would think I
had broken my word about it. I did not, of
course, tell him of her bargain with me over
him, but he probably guessed that, because
before we got into the hansom even, he had
begun to put me through a searching cross-examination
as to the reasons for my behaviour
at Tryland, and Park Street, and the Opera.
I felt like a child with a strong man, and every
moment more idiotically happy, and in love
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>He told the cabman to drive to Hammersmith,
and then put his arm round my waist
again, and held my hand, pulling my glove off
backwards first. It is a great big granny muff
of sable I have, Mrs. Carruthers’ present on
my last birthday. I never thought then to what
charming use it would be put!</p>

<p>“Now I think we have demolished all your
silly little reasons for making me miserable,”
he said. “What others have you to bring
forward as to why you can’t marry me in a
fortnight?”</p>

<p>I was silent&mdash;I did not know how to say it&mdash;the
principal reason of all.</p>

<p>“Evangeline&mdash;darling,” he pleaded. “Oh,
why will you make us both unhappy&mdash;tell me
at least.”</p>

<p>“Your brother, the Duke,” I said, very low.
“He will never consent to your marrying a
person like me with no relations.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a second,&mdash;then, “My
brother is an awfully good fellow,” he said,
“but his mind is warped by his infirmity.
You must not think hardly of him&mdash;he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
love you directly he sees you, like everyone
else.”</p>

<p>“I saw him yesterday,” I said.</p>

<p>Robert was so astonished.</p>

<p>“Where did you see him?” he asked.</p>

<p>Then I told him about meeting Lady Merrenden,
and her asking me to luncheon, and
about her having been in love with papa, and
about the Duke having looked me through
and through with an expression of dislike.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see it all!” said Robert, holding
me closer. “Aunt Sophia and I are great
friends, you know, she has always been like
my mother, who died when I was a baby. I
told her all about you when I came from
Branches, and how I had fallen deeply in love
with you at first sight, and that she must help
me to see you at Tryland; and she did, and then
I thought you had grown to dislike me, so
when I came back she guessed I was unhappy
about something, and this is her first step to
find out how she can do me a good turn&mdash;oh!
she is a dear!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed she is,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course she is extra interested in you if
she was in love with your father! So that is
all right, darling, she must know all about your
family, and can tell Torquilstone. Why, we
have nothing to fear!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes we have!” I said. “I know all
the story of what your brother is <i>toqué</i> about.
Lady Ver told me. You see the awkward part
is, mamma was really nobody, her father and
mother forgot to get married, and although
mamma was lovely, and had been beautifully
brought up by two old ladies at Brighton, it
was a disgrace for papa marrying her&mdash;Mrs.
Carruthers has often taunted me with this!”</p>

<p>“Darling!” he interrupted, and began to
kiss me again, and that gave me such feelings
I could not collect my thoughts to go on with
what I was saying for a few minutes. We both
were rather silly&mdash;if it is silly to be madly,
wildly happy,&mdash;and oblivious of every thing
else.</p>

<p>“I will go straight to Aunt Sophia now,
when I take you back to Claridge’s,” he said,
presently, when we had got a little calmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>I wonder what kisses do that they make one
have that perfectly lovely sensation down the
back, just like certain music does, only much,
much more so. I thought they would be
dreadful things when it was a question of
Christopher, but Robert! Oh well, as I said
before, I can’t think of any other heaven.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” I had sense enough to
ask presently.</p>

<p>He lit a match, and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes past five,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“And Christopher was coming about four,”
I said, “and if you had not chanced to meet
me in the Park, by now I should have been
engaged to him, and probably trying to bear
his kissing me.”</p>

<p>“My God!” said Robert, fiercely, “it
makes me rave to think of it,” and he held
me so tight for a moment, I could hardly
breathe.</p>

<p>“You won’t have anyone else’s kisses ever
again, in this world, and that I tell you,” he
said, through his teeth.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t want them,” I whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
creeping closer to him; “and I never have
had any, never any one but you, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Darling,” he said, “how that pleases me!”</p>

<p>Of course, if I wanted to, I could go on
writing pages and pages of all the lovely things
we said to one another, but it would sound,
even to read to myself, such nonsense, that I
can’t, and I couldn’t make the tone of Robert’s
voice, or the exquisite fascination of his ways&mdash;tender,
and adoring, and masterful. It must
all stay in my heart; but oh! it is as if a fairy
with a wand had passed, and said “bloom”
to a winter tree. Numbers of emotions that
I had never dreamed about were surging
through me&mdash;the flood-gates of everything in
my soul seemed opening in one rush of love
and joy. While we were together, nothing
appeared to matter&mdash;all barriers melted away.</p>

<p>Fate would be sure to be kind to lovers
like us!</p>

<p>We got back to Claridge’s about six, and
Robert would not let me go up to my sitting-room,
until he had found out if Christopher
had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, he had come at four, we discovered,
and had waited twenty minutes, and then left,
saying he would come again at half-past six.</p>

<p>“Then you will write him a note, and give
it to the porter for him, saying you are engaged
to me, and can’t see him,” Robert said.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t do that&mdash;I am not engaged to
you, and cannot be until your family consent,
and are nice to me,” I said.</p>

<p>“Darling,” he faltered, and his voice
trembled with emotion, “darling, love is
between you and me, it is our lives&mdash;however
that can go, the ways of my family, nothing
shall ever separate you from me, or me from
you, I swear it. Write to Christopher.”</p>

<p>I sat down at a table in the hall and wrote,</p>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Carruthers</span>,&mdash;I am sorry I
was out,” then I bit the end of my pen.
“Don’t come and see me this evening. I will
tell you why in a day or two.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Evangeline Travers</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Will that do?” I said, and I handed it to
Robert, while I addressed the envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, and waited while I sealed
it up, and gave it to the porter. Then, with a
surreptitious squeeze of the hand, he left me
to go to Lady Merrenden.</p>

<p>I have come up to my little sitting-room a
changed being. The whole world revolves for
me upon another axis, and all within the space
of three short hours.</p>


<p class="pr4 p2"><span class="smcap">Claridge’s</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Sunday night, Nov. 27th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> this evening, about eight o’clock, when
I had re-locked my journal, I got a note from
Robert. I was just going to begin my dinner.</p>

<p>I tore it open, inside was another, I did not
wait to look from whom, I was too eager to read
his. I paste it in.</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">“<span class="smcap">Carlton House Terrace</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“My darling</span>,&mdash;I have had a long talk
with Aunt Sophia, and she is everything that
is sweet and kind, but she fears Torquilstone
will be a little difficult (<i>I don’t care, nothing</i>
shall separate us now). She asks me not to go
and see you again to-night, as she thinks it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
would be better for you that I should not
go to the Hotel so late. Darling, read her note,
and you will she how nice she is. I shall come
round to-morrow, the moment the beastly
stables are finished, about 12 o’clock. Oh!
take care of yourself! What a difference to-night
and last night! I was feeling horribly
miserable and reckless&mdash;and to-night! Well,
you can guess! I am not half good enough
for you, darling, beautiful Queen&mdash;but I think
I shall know how to make you happy. I love
you!</p>

<p class="pr6">“Good night my own,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Robert</span>.”
</p>

<p>“Do please send me a tiny line by my
servant&mdash;I have told him to wait.”</p>

<p class="p1">I have never had a love letter before. What
lovely things they are! I felt thrills of delight
over bits of it! Of course I see now that I
must have been dreadfully in love with Robert
all along, only I did not know it quite! I fell
into a kind of blissful dream, and then I roused
myself up to read Lady Merrenden’s. I sha’n’t
put hers in too, it fills up too much, and I
can’t shut the clasp of my journal&mdash;it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
perfectly sweet little letter, just saying Robert
had told her the news, and that she was prepared
to welcome me as her dearest niece, and
to do all she could for us. She hoped I would
not think her very tiresome and old fashioned
suggesting Robert had better not see me again
to-night, and if it would not inconvenience
me, she would herself come round to-morrow
morning, and discuss what was best to be done.</p>

<p>Véronique said Lord Robert’s valet was
waiting outside the door, so I flew to my table,
and began to write. My hand trembled so I
made a blot, and had to tear that sheet up, then
I wrote another. Just a little word. I was
frightened, I couldn’t say loving things in a
letter, I had not even spoken many to him&mdash;yet.</p>

<p>“I loved your note,” I began, “and I think
Lady Merrenden is quite right. I will be here
at twelve, and very pleased to see you.” I
wanted to say I loved him, and thought twelve
o’clock a long way off, but of course one could
not write such things as that&mdash;so I ended with
just “Love from <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I read it over, and it did sound
“missish” and silly&mdash;however, with the man
waiting there in the passage, and Véronique
fussing in and out of my bedroom, besides the
waiters bringing up my dinner, I could not go
tearing up sheets, and writing others, it looked
so flurried, so it was put into an envelope.
Then, in one of the seconds I was alone, I
nipped off a violet from a bunch on the table,
and pushed it in too. I wonder if he will think
it sentimental of me! When I had written the
name, I had not an idea where to address it.
His was written from Carlton House Terrace,
but he was evidently not there now, as his
servant had brought it. I felt so nervous and
excited, it was too ridiculous&mdash;I am very calm
as a rule. I called the man, and asked him
where was his lordship now? I did not like
to say I was ignorant of where he lived.</p>

<p>“His lordship is at Vavasour House,
Madame,” he said, respectfully, but with the
faintest shade of surprise that I should not
know. “His lordship dines at home this
evening with his grace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>I scribbled a note to Lady Merrenden&mdash;I
would be delighted to see her in the morning
at whatever time suited her. I would not go
out at all, and I thanked her. It was much
easier to write sweet things to her than to
Robert.</p>

<p>When I was alone I could not eat. Véronique
came in to try and persuade me. I looked
so very pale, she said, she feared I had taken
cold. She was in one of her “old mother”
moods, when she drops the third person sometimes,
and calls me “<i>mon enfant</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Véronique, I have not got a cold, I
am only wildly happy!” I said.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is doubtless <i>fiancée</i> to Mr.
Carruthers. <i>Oh! mon enfant adorée</i>,” she cried,
“<i>que je suis contente!</i>”</p>

<p>“Gracious no!” I exclaimed. This brought
me back to Christopher with a start. What
would he say when he heard?</p>

<p>“No, Véronique, to some one much nicer&mdash;Lord
Robert Vavasour.”</p>

<p>Véronique was frightfully interested&mdash;Mr.
Carruthers she would have preferred for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
she admitted, as being more solid&mdash;more <i>rangé</i>&mdash;<i>plus
à la fin de ses bêtises</i>, but, no doubt,
“Milor” was charming too, and for certain
one day Mademoiselle would be Duchesse. In
the meanwhile what kind of coronet would
Mademoiselle have on her trousseau?</p>

<p>I was obliged to explain that I should not
have any&mdash;or any trousseau for an indefinite
time, as nothing was settled yet. This damped
her a little.</p>

<p>“<i>Un frère de Duc, et pas de couronne!</i>” After
seven years in England she was yet unable to
understand these strange habitudes, she said.</p>

<p>She insisted upon putting me to bed directly
after dinner&mdash;“to be prettier for Milor <i>demain</i>!”
and then, when she had tucked me
up, and was turning out the light in the centre
of the room she looked back&mdash;“Mademoiselle
is too beautiful like that,” she said, as if it
slipped from her&mdash;“<i>Mon Dieu! il ne s’embêterai
pas, le Monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p class="pr6 p1"><span class="smcap">Claridge’s</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Monday morning</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wonder</span> how I lived before I met Robert.
I wonder what use were the days. Oh! and
I wonder, I wonder if the Duke continues to
be obdurate about me if I shall ever have the
strength of mind to part from him so as not
to spoil his future.</p>

<p>Such a short time ago&mdash;not yet four weeks&mdash;since
I was still at Branches, and wondering
what made the clock go round&mdash;the great big
clock of life.</p>

<p>Oh, now I know! It is being in love&mdash;frightfully
in love like we are. I must try
to keep my head though, and remember all
the remarks of Lady Ver about things and
men. Fighters all of them, and they must
never feel quite sure. It will be dreadfully
difficult to tease Robert, because he is so direct
and simple; but I must try I suppose. Perhaps
being so very pretty as I am, and having
all the male creatures looking at me with interest
will do, and be enough to keep him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
worried, and I won’t have to be tiresome
myself. I hope so, because I really do love him
so extremely, I would like to let myself go
and be as sweet as I want to.</p>

<p>I am doing all the things I thought
perfectly silly to hear of before. I kissed his
letter, and slept with it on the pillow beside
me, and this morning woke at six and turned
on the electric light to read it again! The
part where the “Darling” comes is quite
blurry I see in daylight; that is where I
kissed most I know!</p>

<p>I seem to be numb to everything else.
Whether Lady Ver is angry or not does not
bother me. I did play fair. She could not
expect me to go on pretending when Robert
had said straight out he loved me. But I am
sure she will be angry, though, and probably
rather spiteful about it.</p>

<p>I will write her the simple truth in a day
or two, when we see how things go. She
will guess by Robert not going to Sedgwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr2 p1"><span class="smcap">Claridge’s</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2 p1"><i>Monday afternoon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> half past eleven this morning Lady
Merrenden came, and the room was all full
of flowers that Robert had sent&mdash;bunches
and bunches of violets and gardenias. She
kissed me, and held me tight for a moment,
and we did not speak. Then she said in a
voice that trembled a little,</p>

<p>“Robert is so very dear to me&mdash;almost my
own child &mdash;that I want him to be happy, and
you, too, Evangeline&mdash;I may call you that,
may not I?”</p>

<p>I squeezed her hand.</p>

<p>“You are the echo of my youth, when 1,
too, knew the wild springtime of love. So
dear, I need not tell you that you may count
upon my doing what I can for you both.”</p>

<p>Then we talked and talked.</p>

<p>“I must admit,” she said at last, “I
was prejudiced in your favour for your dear
father’s sake, but in any case my opinion of
Robert’s judgement is so high, I would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
been prepared to find you charming even
without that. He has the rarest qualities, he
is the truest, most untarnished soul in this
world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say,” she went on, “that he is
not just as the other young men of his age
and class; he is no Galahad, as no one can be
with truth who is human and lives in the
world. And I daresay kind friends will tell
you stories of actresses and other diversions,
but I who know him, tell you you have won
the best and greatest darling in London.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure of it!” I said. “I don’t
know why he loves me so much, he has seen
me so little; but it began from the very first
minute I think with both of us. He is such
a nice shape!”</p>

<p>She laughed. Then she asked me if she
was right in supposing all these <i>contretemps</i>
we had had were the doing of Lady Ver.
“You need not answer, dear,” she said. “I
know Ianthe&mdash;she is in love with Robert
herself, she can’t help it; she means no harm,
but she often gets these attacks, and they pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
off. I think she is devoted to Sir Charles
really.”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” I said.</p>

<p>“It is a queer world we live in, child,” she
continued, “and true love and suitability of
character are such a rare combination, but,
from what I can judge, you and Robert possess
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how dear of you to say so!” I exclaimed.
“You don’t think I <i>must</i> be bad,
then, because of my colouring?”</p>

<p>“What a ridiculous idea, you sweet child!”
she laughed. “Who has told you that?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Mrs. Carruthers always said so&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the
old gentlemen, and&mdash;even Mr.
Carruthers hinted I probably had some odd
qualities. But you do think I shall be able to
be fairly good, don’t you?”</p>

<p>She was amused I could see, but I was
serious.</p>

<p>“I think you probably might have been a
little wicked if you had married a man like
Mr. Carruthers,” she said, smiling; “but with
Robert I am sure you will be good. He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
never leave you a moment, and he will love
you so much you won’t have time for anything
else.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is what I shall like&mdash;being
loved,” I said.</p>

<p>“I think all women like that,” she sighed.
“We could all of us be good if the person we
love went on being demonstrative. It is the
cold matter-of-fact devotion that kills love,
and makes one want to look elsewhere to find
it again.”</p>

<p>Then we talked of possibilities about the
Duke. I told her I knew his <i>toquade</i>, and
she, of course, was fully acquainted with
mamma’s history.</p>

<p>“I must tell you, dear, I fear he will be
difficult,” she said. “He is a strangely
prejudiced person, and obstinate to a degree,
and he worships Robert, as we all do.”</p>

<p>I would not ask her if the Duke had
taken a dislike to me, because I <i>knew</i> he
had.</p>

<p>“I asked you to meet him on Saturday on
purpose,” she continued. “I felt sure your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
charm would impress him, as it had done
me, and as it did my husband&mdash;but I wonder
now if it would have been better to wait.
He said, after you were gone, that you were
much too beautiful for the peace of any
family, and he pitied Mr. Carruthers if he
married you! I don’t mean to hurt you,
child. I am only telling you everything, so
that we may consult how best to act.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” I said, and I squeezed her
hand again; she does not put out claws like
Lady Ver.</p>

<p>“How did he know anything about Mr.
Carruthers?” I asked, “or me&mdash;or anything?”</p>

<p>She looked ashamed.</p>

<p>“One can never tell how he hears things.
He was intensely interested to meet you,
and seemed to be acquainted with more
of the affair than I am. I almost fear
he must obtain his information from the
servants.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does not that show the housemaid in
him! Poor fellow!” I said, “He can’t help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
it, then, any more than I could help crying
yesterday before Robert in the Park. Of course
we would neither of us have done these things
if it were not for the <i>tache</i> in our backgrounds,
only, fortunately for me, mine wasn’t a housemaid,
and was one generation further back,
so I would not be likely to have any of those
tricks.”</p>

<p>She leant back in her chair and laughed.
“You quaint, quaint child, Evangeline,” she
said.</p>

<p>Just then it was twelve o’clock and Robert
came in.</p>

<p>Oh! talk of hearts beating. If mine is
going to go on jumping like this every time
Robert enters a room, I shall get a disease in
it in less than a year.</p>

<p>He looked too intensely attractive; he was
not in London clothes, just serge things and
a Guard’s tie, and his face was beaming, and
his eyes shining like blue stars.</p>

<p>We behaved nicely; he only kissed my
hand, and Lady Merrenden looked away at
the clock even for that! She has tact!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t my Evangeline a darling, Aunt
Sophia?  he said. “And don’t you love her
red hair?”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” said Lady Merrenden.</p>

<p>“When you leave us alone I am going to
pull it all down,” and he whispered, “darling,
I love you,” so close, that his lips touched
my ear, while he pretended he was not doing
anything! I say again, Robert has ways which
would charm a stone image.</p>

<p>“How was Torquilstone last night?” Lady
Merrenden asked. “And did you tell him anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” said Robert. “I wanted to
wait and consult you both which would be
best. Shall I go to him at once, or shall he
be made to meet my Evangeline again and
let her fascinate him, as she is bound to do,
and then tell him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell him straight!” I exclaimed, remembering
his proclivities about the servants,
and that Véronique knows. “Then he cannot
ever say we have deceived him.”</p>

<p>“That is how I feel,” said Robert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“You take Evangeline to lunch, Aunt Sophia,
and I will go back and feed with him and
tell him, and then come to you after.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that will be best,” she said, and it
was settled that she should come in again and
fetch me in an hour, when Robert should
leave to go to Vavasour House. He went
with her to the lift, and then he came back.</p>

<p>No&mdash;even in this locked book I am not
going to write of that hour&mdash;it was too divine.
If I had thought just sitting in the Park was
heaven, I now know there are degrees of
heaven, and that Robert is teaching me up
towards the seventh.</p>

<p class="pr2 p2"><i>Monday afternoon (continued).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I forgot</span> to say a note came from Christopher
by this morning’s post&mdash;it made me
laugh when I read it, then it went out of my
head, but when Lady Merrenden returned for
me, and we were more or less sane again&mdash;Robert
and I&mdash;I thought of it; so apparently
did he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you by chance hear from Christopher
whether he got your note last night or
no?” he said.</p>

<p>I went and fetched it from my bedroom
when I put on my hat. Robert read it aloud:</p>

<p class="pr6 p1">“<span class="smcap">Travellers’ Club</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<i>Sunday night</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Souvent femme varie, fol qui se fie!</i>”</p>

<p>Hope you found your variation worth while.</p>

<p class="pr2">“C. C.”</p>

<p class="p1">“What dam cheek!” he said in his old
way; he hasn’t used any “ornaments to conversation”
since we have been&mdash;oh! I want
to say it&mdash;engaged!</p>

<p>Then his eyes flashed. “Christopher had
better be careful of himself. He will have to
be answerable to me now!”</p>

<p>“Do be prudent, Evangeline, dear!” Lady
Merrenden said gaily, “or you will have
Robert breaking the head of every man in
the street who even glances at you! He is
frantically jealous!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know I am,” said Robert, rearranging
the tie on my blouse with that air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of <i>sans gêne</i> and possession that pleases me
so.</p>

<p>I belong to him now, and if my tie isn’t as
he likes, he has a perfect right to re-tie it! No
matter who is there! That is his attitude, not
the <i>least</i> ceremony or stuff, everything perfectly
simple and natural!</p>

<p>It does make things agreeable. When I was
“Miss Travers” and he “Lord Robert,” he
was always respectful and unfamiliar&mdash;except
that one night when rage made him pinch my
finger! but now that I am <i>his</i> Evangeline, and
he is <i>my</i> Robert (thus he explained it to me
in our Paradise hour) I am his queen and
his darling&mdash;but at the same time his possession
and belonging, just the same as his watch
or his coat. I adore it, and it does not make
me the least “uppish,” as one might have
thought.</p>

<p>“Come, come, children!” Lady Merrenden
said at last, “we shall all be late!”</p>

<p>So we started, dropping Robert at Vavasour
House on our way. It is a splendid place,
down one of those side streets looking on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Green Park, and has a small garden that side.
I had never been down to the little square
where it is before, but, of course, every one can
see its splendid frontage from St. James’s Park,
though I had never realized it was Vavasour
House.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” whispered Lady Merrenden
as Robert got out, and then we drove on.</p>

<p>Several people were lunching at Carlton
House Terrace, Cabinet Ministers, and a
clever novelist, and the great portrait painter,
besides two or three charming women, one
as pretty and smart as Lady Ver, but the
others more ordinary looking, only so well
mannered. No real frumps like the Montgomeries.
We had a delightful lunch, and I
tried to talk nicely, and do my best to please
my dear hostess. When they had all left I
think we both began to feel excited, and long
apprehensively for the arrival of Robert. So
we talked of the late guests.</p>

<p>“It amuses my husband to see a number of
different kinds of people,” she said, “but we
had nothing very exciting to-day, I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
confess&mdash;though sometimes the authors and
authoresses bore me&mdash;and they are often very
disappointing, one does not any longer care
to read their books after seeing them.”</p>

<p>I said I could quite believe that.</p>

<p>“I do not go in for budding geniuses,” she
continued, “I prefer to wait until they have
arrived&mdash;no matter their origin, then they have
acquired a certain outside behaviour on the
way up, and it does not <i>froissé</i> one so. Merrenden
is a great judge of human nature, and
variety entertains him. Left to myself I fear
I should be quite contented with less gifted
people who were simply of one’s own world.”</p>

<p>In all her talk one can see her thought and
consideration for Lord Merrenden and his
wishes and tastes.</p>

<p>“I always feel it is so cruel for him our
having no children,” she said; “the Earldom
becomes extinct, so I must make him as happy
as I can.”</p>

<p>What a dear and just woman!</p>

<p>At last we spoke of Robert, and she told me
stories of his boyhood, amusing Eton scrapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and later feats. And how brave and splendid
he had been in the war; and how the people
all adored him at Torquilstone; and of his
popularity and influence with them. “You
must make him go into Parliament,” she
said.</p>

<p>Then Robert came into the room. Oh! his
darling face spoke, there was no need for words!
The Duke, one could see, had been obdurate.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Lady Merrenden.</p>

<p>Robert came straight over to me, and took
my face in his two hands: “Darling,” he said,
“before everything I want you to know I love
you better than anything else in the world, and
nothing will make any difference,” and he
kissed me deliberately before his aunt. His
voice was so moved&mdash;and we all felt a slight
lump in our throats, I know; then he stood
in front of us, but he held my hand.</p>

<p>“Torquilstone was horrid, I can see,” said
Lady Merrenden. “What did he say, Robert&mdash;tell
us everything? Evangeline would wish
it too, I am sure, as well as I.”</p>

<p>Robert looked very pale and stern, one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
see how firm his jaw is in reality, and how
steady his dear blue eyes.</p>

<p>“I told him I loved Evangeline, whom I
understood he had met yesterday, and that I
intended to marry her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And he said?” asked Lady Merrenden,
breathless.</p>

<p>I only held tighter Robert’s hand.</p>

<p>“He swore like a trooper, he thumped his
glass down on the table and smashed it&mdash;a
disgusting exhibition of temper&mdash;I was ashamed
of him. Then he said, ‘Never, as long as he
lived and could prevent it&mdash;that he had heard
something of my infatuation, so as I am not
given that way he had made inquiries, and
found the family was most unsatisfactory.’
Then he had come here yesterday on purpose
to see you&mdash;darling,” turning to me&mdash;“and
that he had judged for himself. The girl was
a ‘devilish beauty’ (his words not mine) with
the naughtiest provoking eyes, and a mouth&mdash;No!
I can’t say the rest, it makes me too mad!”
and Robert’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden rose from her seat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
came and took my other hand. I felt as if I
could not stand too tall and straight.</p>

<p>“The long and short of it is, he has absolutely
refused to have anything to do with
the matter; says I need expect nothing further
from him, and we have parted for good and
all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Robert!” it was almost a cry from
Lady Merrenden.</p>

<p>Robert put his arms round me, and his face
changed to radiance.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care&mdash;what does it matter!
A few places and thousands in the dim future&mdash;the
loss of them is nothing to me if I have
only my Evangeline now.”</p>

<p>“But, Robert, dearest,” Lady Merrenden
said, “you can’t possibly live without what
he allows you, what have you of your own?
About eighteen hundred a year, I suppose, and
you know, darling boy, you are often in debt.
Why he paid five thousand for you as lately as
last Easter. Oh, what is to be done!” and she
clasped her hands.</p>

<p>I felt as if turned to stone. Was all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
divine happiness going to slip from my grasp?
Yes, it looked like it, for I could never drag
Robert into poverty, and spoil his great future.</p>

<p>“He can’t leave away Torquilstone, and
those thousands of profitless acres,” Lady
Merrenden went on, “but unfortunately the
London property is at his disposition. Oh! I
must go and talk to him!”</p>

<p>“No!” said Robert. “It would not be the
least use, and would look as if we were pleading.
His face had fallen to intense sadness
as Lady Merrenden spoke of his money.</p>

<p>“Darling,” he said, in a broken voice.
“No, it is true it would not be fair to make
you a beggar. I should be a cad to ask you.
We must think of some way of softening my
brother after all!”</p>

<p>Then I spoke.</p>

<p>“Robert,” I said, “if you were only John
Smith I would say I would willingly go and
live with you in a cottage, or even in a slum&mdash;but
you are not, and I would not for <i>anything
in the world</i> drag you down out of what is your
position in life&mdash;that would be a poor sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
love. Oh! my dear,” and I clasped tight his
hand&mdash;“if everything fails, then we must part,
and you must forget me.”</p>

<p>He folded me in his arms, and we heard the
door shut. Lady Merrenden had left us alone.
Oh! it was anguish and divine bliss at the
same time the next half hour.</p>

<p>“I will never forget you, and never in this
world will I take another woman, I swear to
God,” he said at the end of it. “If we must
part, then life is finished for me of all joy.”</p>

<p>“And for me, too, Robert!”</p>

<p>We said the most passionate vows of love to
one another, but I will not write them here,
there is another locked book where I keep them&mdash;the
book of my soul.</p>

<p>“Would it be any good if Colonel Tom Carden
went and spoke to him?” I asked, presently.
“He was best man at papa’s wedding, and
knows all that there is to be known of poor
mamma, and do you think that as mamma’s
father was Lord de Brandreth, a very old barony,
I believe, it is&mdash;oh! can it make any difference
to the children’s actual breeding, their parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
not having been through the marriage ceremony?
I&mdash;I&mdash;don’t know much of those sort of things!”</p>

<p>“My sweet!” said Robert, and through
all our sorrow he smiled and kissed me, “my
sweet, sweet Evangeline.”</p>

<p>“But does the Duke know all the details
of the history,” I asked, when I could speak&mdash;one
can’t when one is being kissed.</p>

<p>“Every little bit, it seems. He says he will
not discuss the matter of that, I must know
it is quite enough, as I have always known
his views, but if they were not sufficient, your
wild, wicked beauty is. You would not be
faithful to me for a year, he said. I could
hardly keep from killing him when he hurled
that at my head.”</p>

<p>I felt my temper rising. How frightfully
unjust&mdash;how cruel. I went over and looked
in the glass&mdash;a big mirror between the window&mdash;drawing
Robert with me.</p>

<p>“Oh! tell me, tell me what is it. Am I so
very bad looking? It is a curse surely that is
upon me!”</p>

<p>“Of course you are not bad looking, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
darling!” exclaimed Robert. “You are perfectly
beautiful&mdash;slender, stately, exquisite
tiger-lily&mdash;only&mdash;only&mdash;you don’t look cold&mdash;and
it is just your red hair, and those fascinating
green eyes, and your white lovely skin and
black eyelashes that, that&mdash;oh! you know,
you sweetheart! You don’t look like bread and
butter, you are utterly desirable, and you would
make any one’s heart beat!”</p>

<p>I thought of the night at “Carmen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am wicked,” I said, “but I never
will be again&mdash;only just enough to make you
always love me, because Lady Ver says security
makes yawns. But even wicked people can
love with a great, great love, and that can keep
them good. Oh! if he only knew how utterly
I love you, Robert, I am sure, sure, he would
be kind to us!”</p>

<p>“Well, how shall we tell him?”</p>

<p>Then a thought came to me, and I felt all
over a desperate thrill of excitement.</p>

<p>“Will you do nothing until to-morrow?”
I said. “I have an idea which I will tell to no
one. Let us go back to Claridge’s now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
do not come and see me again until to-morrow
at twelve. Then if this has failed, we will say
good-bye. It is a desperate chance.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t tell me what it is?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;please trust me&mdash;it is my life as well
as yours, remember.”</p>

<p>“My queen!” he said. “Yes, I will do
that, or anything else you wish, only <i>never,
never</i> good-bye. I am a man after all, and have
numbers of influential relations. I can do
something else in life but just be a Guardsman,
and we shall get enough money to live quite
happily on&mdash;though we might not be very
grand people. I will never say good-bye&mdash;do
you hear. Promise me you will never say it
either.”</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>“Evangeline, darling!” he cried, in anguish,
his eyebrows right up in the old way, while
two big tears welled up in his beautiful eyes.
“My God! won’t you answer me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will!” I said, and I threw all my
reserve to the winds, and flung my arms round
his neck passionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“I love you with my heart and soul, and
pray to God we shall never say good-bye.”</p>

<p>When I got back to Claridge’s, for the first
time in my life I felt a little faint. Lady
Merrenden had driven me back herself, and
left me, with every assurance of her devotion
and affection for us. I had said good-bye to
Robert for the day at Carlton House Terrace.</p>

<p>They do not yet know me, either of them&mdash;quite&mdash;or
what I can and will do.</p>

<p class="pr4 p2"><span class="smcap">Claridge’s</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Monday night</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I felt</span> to carry out my plan I must steady
my mind a little, so I wrote my journal, and
that calmed me.</p>

<p>Of all the things I was sure of in the world
I was most sure that I loved Robert far too
well to injure his prospects. On the other
hand to throw him away without a struggle
was too cruel to both of us. If mamma’s
mother was nobody, all the rest of my family
were fine old fighters and gentlemen, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
really prayed to their shades to help me
now.</p>

<p>Then I rang and ordered some iced water,
and when I had thought deeply for a few
minutes, while I sipped it, I sat down to my
writing-table. My hand did not shake, though
I felt at a deadly tension. I addressed the
envelope first, to steady myself:</p>

<p class="pi8"><i>To</i></p>
<p class="pi10"><i>His Grace</i>,</p>
<p class="pr6"><span class="smcap">The Duke of Torquilstone</span>,</p>
<p class="pr4"><i>Vavasour House,</i></p>
<p class="pr2"><i>St. James’s, S.W.</i></p>

<p class="p1">Then I put that aside.</p>

<p>“I am Evangeline Travers who writes,” I
began, without any preface, “and I ask if you
will see me&mdash;either here in my sitting-room
this evening, or I will come to you at Vavasour
House. I understand your brother, Lord
Robert, has told you that he loves me, and
wishes to marry me, and that you have refused
your consent, partly because of the history of
my family, but chiefly because my type displeases
you. I believe, in days gone by, the
prerogative of a great noble like you was to
dispense justice. In my case it is still your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
prerogative by courtesy, and I ask it of you.
When we have talked for a little, if you then
hold to your opinion of me, and convince me
that it is for your brother’s happiness, I swear
to you on my word of honour I will never see
him again.</p>

<p class="pr6">“Believe me,</p>
<p class="pr4">“Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Evangeline Travers</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">I put it hastily in the envelope, and fastened
it up. Then I rang the bell, and had it sent by
a messenger in a cab, who was to wait for an
answer. Oh! I wonder in life if I shall ever
have to go through another twenty-five minutes
like those that passed before the waiter brought
a note up to me in reply.</p>

<p>Even if the journal won’t shut I must put
it in.</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">“<span class="smcap">Vavasour House</span>,</p>
<p class="pr6">“<i>St. James’s</i>,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<i>Nov. 28th</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I have received your
letter, and request you to excuse my calling
upon you at your hotel this evening, as I am
very unwell, but if you will do me the honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to come to Vavasour House on receipt of this,
I will discuss the matter in question with you,
and trust you will believe that you may rely
upon my <i>justice</i>.</p>

<p class="pr4">“I remain, Madam,</p>
<p class="pr6">“Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Torquilstone</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">“His grace’s brougham is waiting below
for you, Madam,” the waiter said, and I flew
to Véronique.</p>

<p>I got her to dress me quickly. I wore the
same things exactly as he had seen me in before,
deep mourning they are, and extremely becoming.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes Véronique and I were
seated in the brougham and rolling on our
way. I did not speak.</p>

<p>I was evidently expected, for as the carriage
stopped the great doors flew open, and I could
see into the dim and splendid hall.</p>

<p>A silver-haired, stately old servant led
me along, through a row of powdered footmen,
down a passage dimly lit with heavily
shaded lights (Véronique was left to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
mercies). Then the old man opened a door,
and without announcing my name, merely,
“The lady, your grace,” he held the door,
and then went out and closed it softly.</p>

<p>It was a huge room splendidly panelled
with dark carved <i>boiserie</i> Louis XV, the most
beautiful of its kind I had ever seen, only it
was so dimly lit with the same sort of shaded
lamps one could hardly see into the corners.</p>

<p>The Duke was crouching in a chair, he
looked fearfully pale and ill, and had an inscrutable
expression on his face. Fancy a man
so old-looking, and crippled, being even
Robert’s half-brother!</p>

<p>I came forward; he rose with difficulty, and
this is the conversation we had.</p>

<p>“Please don’t get up,” I said, “if I may
sit down opposite you.”</p>

<p>“Excuse my want of politeness,” he replied,
pointing to a chair, “but my back is causing
me great pain to-day.”</p>

<p>He looked such a poor miserable, soured,
unhappy creature, I could not help being
touched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry!” I said. “If I had
known you were ill, I would not have troubled
you now.”</p>

<p>“Justice had better not wait,” he answered,
with a whimsical, cynical, sour smile. “State
your case.”</p>

<p>Then he suddenly turned on an electric
lamp near me, which made a blaze of light in
my face. I did not jump. I am glad to say I
have pretty good nerves.</p>

<p>“My case is this: to begin with, I love
your brother better than anything else in the
world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Possibly: a number of women have done
so,” he interrupted. “Well?”</p>

<p>“And he loves me,” I continued, not noticing
the interruption.</p>

<p>“Agreed. It is a situation that happens
every day among young fools. You have known
one another about a month, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Under four weeks,” I corrected.</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“It cannot be of such vital importance to
you then in that short time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is of vital importance to me, and you
know your brother’s character; you will be
able to judge as well as I if, or not, it is a
matter of vital importance to him.”</p>

<p>He frowned. “Well, your case.”</p>

<p>“First, to demand on what grounds you
condemned me as a ‘devilish beauty?’ and
why you assume that I should not be faithful
to Robert for a year?”</p>

<p>“I am rather a good judge of character,” he
said.</p>

<p>“You cannot be&mdash;or you would see that
whatever accident makes me have this objectionable
outside, the me that lives within is an
honest person who never breaks her word.”</p>

<p>“I can only see red hair and green eyes,
and a general look of the devil.”</p>

<p>“Would you wish people always to judge
by appearances then?” I said. “Because, if so,
I see before me a prejudiced, narrow-minded,
cruel-tempered, cynical man, jealous of youth’s
joys. But <i>I</i> would not be so unjust as to stamp
you with these qualities because of that!”</p>

<p>He looked straight at me, startled. “I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
be all those things,” he said. “You are probably
right!”</p>

<p>“Then, oh, please don’t be!” I went on
quickly. “I want you to be kind to us. We,
oh, we do, do so wish to be happy, and we are
both so young, and life will be so utterly blank
and worthless for all these years to the end if
you part us now.”</p>

<p>“I did not say I would part you,” he said,
coldly. “I merely said I refused to give Robert
any allowance, and I shall leave everything in
my power away from the title. If you like to
get married on those terms you are welcome
to.”</p>

<p>Then I told him I loved Robert far too much
to like the thought of spoiling his future.</p>

<p>“We came into each others lives,” I said.
“We did not ask it of Fate, she pushed us
there; and I tried not to speak to him because
I had promised a friend of mine I would not,
as she said she liked him herself, and it made
us both dreadfully unhappy, and every day we
mattered more to one another; until yesterday&mdash;when
I thought he had gone away for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
good, and I was too miserable for words&mdash;we
met in the Park, and it was no use pretending
any longer. Oh! you <i>can’t</i> want to crush out
all joy and life for us, just because I have red
hair! It is so horribly unjust.”</p>

<p>“You beautiful siren,” he said. “You are
coaxing me. How you know how to use your
charms and your powers; and what <i>man</i> could
resist your tempting face!”</p>

<p>I rose in passionate scorn.</p>

<p>“How dare you say such things to me!”
I said. “I would not stoop to coax you&mdash;I
will not again ask you for any boon! I only
wanted you to do me the justice of realizing
you had made a mistake in my character&mdash;to
do your brother the justice of conceding the
point that he has some right to love whom he
chooses. But keep your low thoughts to yourself!
Evil, cruel man! Robert and I have got
something that is better than all your lands and
money&mdash;a dear, great love, and I am glad;
glad that he will not in the future receive anything
that is in your gift. I shall give him the
gift of myself, and we shall do very well without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
you,” and I walked to the door, leaving
him huddled in the chair.</p>

<p>Thus ended our talk on justice!</p>

<p>Never has my head been so up in the air.
I am sure had Cleopatra been dragged to Rome
in Augustus’s triumph she would not have
walked with more pride and contempt than I
through the hall of Vavasour House.</p>

<p>The old servant was waiting for me, and
Véronique, and the brougham.</p>

<p>“Call a hansom, if you please,” I said, and
stood there like a statue while one of the footmen
had to run into St. James’s Street for it.</p>

<p>Then we drove away, and I felt my teeth
chatter, while my cheeks burnt. Oh! what an
end to my scheme, and my dreams of perhaps
success!</p>

<p>But what a beast of a man! What a cruel,
warped, miserable creature. I will not let him
separate me from Robert, never, never! He is
not worth it. I will wait for him&mdash;my darling&mdash;and,
if he really loves me, some day we can
be happy, and if he does not&mdash;but oh! I need
not fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>I am still shaking with passion, and shall go
to bed. I do not want any dinner.</p>

<p class="pr2 p4"><i>Tuesday morning, Nov. 29th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Véronique</span> would not let me go to bed, she
insisted upon my eating, and then after dinner
I sat in an old, but lovely wrap of white crêpe,
and she brushed out my hair for more than an
hour&mdash;there is such a tremendous lot of it, it
takes time.</p>

<p>I sat in front of the sitting-room fire, and
tried not to think. One does feel a wreck after
a scene like that. At about half past nine I
heard noises in the passage of people, and with
only a preliminary tap Robert and Lady
Merrenden came into the room. I started up,
and Véronique dropped the brush, in her
astonishment, and then left us alone.</p>

<p>Both their eyes were shining, and excited,
and Robert looked crazy with joy; he seized
me in his arms and kissed me, and kissed me,
while Lady Merrenden said, “You darling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Evangeline, you plucky, clever girl, tell us all
about it!”</p>

<p>“About what!” I said, as soon as I could
speak.</p>

<p>“How you managed it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I must kiss her first, Aunt Sophia!”
said Robert. “Did you ever see anything so
divinely lovely as she looks with her hair all
floating like this&mdash;and it is all mine&mdash;every
bit of it!!!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” I said sadly. “And that is
about all of value you will get!”</p>

<p>“Come and sit down,” said Robert, “Evangeline,
you darling&mdash;and look at this!”</p>

<p>Upon which he drew from his pocket a note.
I saw at once it was the Duke’s writing, and
I shivered with excitement. He held it before
my eyes.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Robert</span>,” it began, “I have seen her.
I am conquered. She will make a magnificent
Duchess. Bring her to lunch to-morrow.
Yours, <span class="smcap">Torquilstone</span>.”</p>

<p>I really felt so intensely moved I could not
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, tell us, dear child, how did it happen&mdash;and
what did you do&mdash;and where did you
meet?” said Lady Merrenden.</p>

<p>Robert held my hand.</p>

<p>Then I tried to tell them as well as I could,
and they listened breathlessly. “I was very
rude, I fear,” I ended with, “but I was so
angry.”</p>

<p>“It is glorious,” said Robert. “But the
best part is that you intended to give me yourself
with no prospect of riches. Oh, darling,
that is the best gift of all.”</p>

<p>“Was it disgustingly selfish of me?” I said.
“But when I saw your poor brother so unhappy
looking, and soured, and unkind, with
all his grandeur, I felt that to us, who know
what love means, to be together was the thing
that matters most in all the world.”</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden then said she knew some
people staying here who had an <i>appartement</i> on
the first floor, and she would go down and see
if they were visible. She would wait for Robert
in the hall, she said, and she kissed us good-night,
and gave us her blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>What a dear she is! What a nice pet to leave
us alone!</p>

<p>Robert and I passed another hour of bliss,
and I think we must have got to the sixth
heaven by now. Robert says the seventh is
for the end, when we are married&mdash;well, that
will be soon. Oh! I am too happy to write
coherently.</p>

<p>I did not wake till late this morning, and
Véronique came and said my sitting-room was
again full of flowers. The darling Robert is!</p>

<p>I wrote to Christopher and Lady Ver, in bed
as I sipped my chocolate. I just told Lady Ver
the truth, that Robert and I had met by chance,
and discovered we loved one another, so I knew
she would understand&mdash;and I promised I would
not break his heart. Then I thanked her for
all her kindness to me, but I felt sad when I
read it over&mdash;poor, dear Lady Ver&mdash;how I
hope it won’t really hurt her, and that she will
forgive me.</p>

<p>To Christopher I said I had found my
“variation” worth while, and I hoped he would
come to my wedding some day soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I sent Véronique to post them both.</p>

<p>To-day I am moving to Carlton House
Terrace. What a delight that will be&mdash;and in
a fortnight, or at best three weeks, Robert says
we shall quietly go and get married, and
Colonel Tom Carden can give me away after all.</p>

<p>Oh the joy of the dear, beautiful world,
and this sweet, dirty, enshrouding fog-bound
London! I love it all&mdash;even the smuts!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 p2"><span class="smcap">Carlton House Terrace</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Thursday night</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> came to see me at twelve, and he
brought me the loveliest, splendid diamond
and emerald ring, and I danced about like a
child with delight over it. He has the most
exquisite sentiment, Robert, every little trifle
has some delicate meaning, and he makes me
<i>feel</i> and <i>feel</i>.</p>

<p>Each hour we spend together we seem to
discover some new bit of us which is just what
the other wants. And he is so deliciously
jealous and masterful and&mdash;oh! I love him&mdash;so
there it is!</p>

<p>I am learning a number of things, and I am
sure there are lots to learn still.</p>

<p>At half past one Lady Merrenden came, and
fetched us in the <i>barouche</i>, and off we went to
Vavasour House, with what different feelings
to last evening.</p>

<p>The pompous servants received us in state,
and we all three walked on to the Duke’s
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>There he was, still huddled in his chair, but
he got up&mdash;he is better to-day.</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden went over and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Dear Torquilstone,” she said.</p>

<p>“Morning, Robert,” he mumbled, after he
had greeted his aunt. “Introduce me to your
<i>fiancée</i>.”</p>

<p>And Robert did with great ceremony.</p>

<p>“Now, I won’t call you names any more,”
I said, and I laughed in his face. He bent
down, and kissed my forehead.</p>

<p>“You are a beautiful tiger cat,” he said,
“but even a year of you would be well worth
while.”</p>

<p>Upon which Robert glared, and I laughed
again, and we all went in to lunch.</p>

<p>He is not so bad, the Duke, after all!</p>

<p class="pr4 p2"><span class="smcap">Carlton House Terrace</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Dec. 21st.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oh</span>! it is three weeks since I wrote, but I
have been too busy, and too happy, for journals.
I have been here ever since, getting my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
trousseau, and Véronique is becoming used to
the fact that I can have no coronet on my
<i>lingerie</i>!</p>

<p>It is the loveliest thing in the world being
engaged to Robert!</p>

<p>He has ways!&mdash;Well, even if I really were
as bad as I suppose I look, I could never want
any one else. He worships me, and lets me
order him about, and then he orders me about,
and that makes me have the loveliest thrills!
And if any one even looks at me in the street,
which of course they always do&mdash;he flashes
blue fire at them, and I feel&mdash;oh! I feel, all
the time!</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden continues her sweet kindness
to us, and her tact is beyond words, and
now I often do what I used to wish to&mdash;that
is, touch Robert’s eyelashes with the tips of
my fingers!</p>

<p>It is perfectly lovely.</p>

<p>Oh, what in the world is the good of anything
else in life, but being frantically in love
like we are.</p>

<p>It all seems, to look back upon, as if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
like having porridge for breakfast, and nothing
else every day&mdash;before I met Robert!</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because he is going to be very
grand in the future, but every one has discovered
I am a beauty, and intelligent. It is
much nicer to be thought that than just to be
a red-haired adventuress.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine, even, has sent me a cairngorm
brooch and a cordial letter (should
now adorn her circle!)</p>

<p>But oh! what do they all matter&mdash;what does
anything matter but Robert! All day long I
know I am learning the meaning of “to dance
and to sing and to laugh and <i>to live</i>.”</p>

<p>The Duke and I are great friends, he has
ferreted out about mamma’s mother, and it
appears she was a Venetian music mistress of
the name of Tonquini, or something like that,
who taught Lord de Brandreth’s sisters&mdash;so
perhaps Lady Ver was right after all, and far,
far back in some other life, I was the friend of
a Doge.</p>

<p>Poor dear Lady Ver! she has taken it very
well after the first spiteful letter, and now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
don’t think there is even a tear at the corner
of her eye!</p>

<p>Lady Merrenden says it is just the time of
the year when she usually gets a new one, so
perhaps she has now, and so that is all right.</p>

<p>The diamond serpent she has given me has
emerald eyes&mdash;and such a pointed tongue.</p>

<p>“It is like you, Snake-girl,” she said, “so
wear it at your wedding.”</p>

<p>The three angels are to be my only bridesmaids.</p>

<p>Robert loads me with gifts, and the Duke
is going to let me wear all the Torquilstone
jewels when I am married, besides the emeralds
he has given me himself. I really love him.</p>

<p>Christopher sent me this characteristic note
with the earrings which are his gift, great big
emeralds set with diamonds:</p>

<p class="p1">“So sorry I shall not see you on the happy
day, but Paris, I am fortunate enough to discover,
still has joys for me.</p>

<p class="pr2">“C. C.</p>

<p class="p1">“Wear them, they will match your eyes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>And to-morrow is my wedding-day, and I
am going away on a honeymoon with Robert&mdash;away
into the seventh heaven. And oh!
and oh! I am certain <i>sure</i> neither of us will
yawn!</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
